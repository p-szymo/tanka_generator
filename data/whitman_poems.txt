primeval my love for the woman i love, 
 o bride! o wife! more resistless, more enduring than i can tell, the thought of you! 
 then separate, as disembodied, the purest born, 
 the ethereal, the last athletic reality, my consolation, 
 i ascend i float in the regions of your love, o man, 
 o sharer of my roving life. 
 o magnet south! o glistening, perfumed south! my south! 
 o quick mettle, rich blood, impulse, and love! good and evil! o all dear to me! 
 o dear to me my birth things all moving things, and the trees where i was 
 	  	  born the 
 	  grains, 
 	  plants, rivers; 
 dear to me my own slow sluggish rivers where they flow, distant, over flats of silvery 
 	  	  sands, 
 	  or 
 	  through swamps; 
 dear to me the roanoke, the savannah, the altamahaw, the pedee, the tombigbee, the santee, 
 	  	  the 
 	  coosa, and the sabine; 
 o pensive, far away wandering, i return with my soul to haunt their banks again; 
 again in florida i float on transparent lakes i float on the okeechobee i cross 
 	  	  the 
 	  hummock land, or through pleasant openings, or dense forests; 
 i see the parrots in the woods i see the papaw tree and the blossoming titi; 
 again, sailing in my coaster, on deck, i coast off georgia i coast up the carolinas, 
 i see where the live oak is growing i see where the yellow pine, the scented 
 	  	  bay tree, the 
 	  lemon and orange, the cypress, the graceful palmetto; 
 i pass rude sea headlands and enter pamlico sound through an inlet, and dart my vision 
 	  	  inland; 
 o the cotton plant! the growing fields of rice, sugar, hemp! 
 the cactus, guarded with thorns the laurel tree, with large white flowers; 
 the range afar the richness and barrenness the old woods charged with mistletoe 
 	  	  and 
 	  trailing moss, 
 the piney odor and the gloom the awful natural stillness, (here in these dense swamps 
 	  	  the 
 	  freebooter carries his gun, and the fugitive slave has his conceal'd hut;) 
 o the strange fascination of these half known, half impassable swamps, infested by 
 	  	  reptiles, 
 	  resounding with the bellow of the alligator, the sad noises of the night owl and the 
 	  	  wild cat, 
 	  and 
 	  the whirr of the rattlesnake; 
 the mocking bird, the american mimic, singing all the forenoon singing through the 
 	  moon lit 
 	  night, 
 the humming bird, the wild turkey, the raccoon, the opossum; 
 a tennessee corn field the tall, graceful, long leav'd corn slender, 
 	  	  flapping, 
 	  bright 
 	  green with tassels with beautiful ears, each well sheath'd in its husk; 
 an arkansas prairie a sleeping lake, or still bayou; 
 o my heart! o tender and fierce pangs i can stand them not i will depart; 
 o to be a virginian, where i grew up! o to be a carolinian! 
 o longings irrepressible! o i will go back to old tennessee, and never wander more! 
 1 
 afoot and light hearted, i take to the open road, 
 healthy, free, the world before me, 
 the long brown path before me, leading wherever i choose. 
 	 
 henceforth i ask not good fortune i myself am good fortune; 
 henceforth i whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing, 
 strong and content, i travel the open road. 
 	 
 the earth that is sufficient; 
 i do not want the constellations any nearer; 
 i know they are very well where they are; 
 i know they suffice for those who belong to them. 
 	 
 (still here i carry my old delicious burdens; 
 i carry them, men and women i carry them with me wherever i go; 
 i swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them; 
 i am fill'd with them, and i will fill them in return.) 
 	 
 2 
 you road i enter upon and look around! i believe you are not all that is here; 
 i believe that much unseen is also here. 
 	 
 here the profound lesson of reception, neither preference or denial; 
 the black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas'd, the illiterate person, are not 
 	  	  denied; 
 	 
 the birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar's tramp, the drunkard's stagger, 
 	  	  the 
 	  laughing party of mechanics, 
 the escaped youth, the rich person's carriage, the fop, the eloping couple, 
 the early market man, the hearse, the moving of furniture into the town, the return back 
 	  	  from 
 	  the 
 	  town, 
 they pass i also pass anything passes none can be interdicted; 
 none but are accepted none but are dear to me. 
 	 
 3 
 you air that serves me with breath to speak! 
 you objects that call from diffusion my meanings, and give them shape! 
 you light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers! 
 you paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides! 
 i think you are latent with unseen existences you are so dear to me. 
 	 
 you flagg'd walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges! 
 you ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timber lined sides! you distant ships! 
 you rows of houses! you window pierc'd faã§ades! you roofs! 
 you porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards! 
 you windows whose transparent shells might expose so much! 
 you doors and ascending steps! you arches! 
 you gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings! 
 from all that has been near you, i believe you have imparted to yourselves, and now would 
 	  impart the 
 	  same secretly to me; 
 from the living and the dead i think you have peopled your impassive surfaces, and the 
 	  	  spirits 
 	  thereof would be evident and amicable with me. 
 	 
 4 
 the earth expanding right hand and left hand, 
 the picture alive, every part in its best light, 
 the music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping where it is not wanted, 
 the cheerful voice of the public road the gay fresh sentiment of the road. 
 	 
 o highway i travel! o public road! do you say to me, do not leave me? 
 do you say, venture not? if you leave me, you are lost? 
 do you say, i am already prepared i am well beaten and undenied adhere to me? 
 	 
 o public road! i say back, i am not afraid to leave you yet i love you; 
 you express me better than i can express myself; 
 you shall be more to me than my poem. 
 	 
 i think heroic deeds were all conceiv'd in the open air, and all great poems also; 
 i think i could stop here myself, and do miracles; 
 (my judgments, thoughts, i henceforth try by the open air, the road;) 
 i think whatever i shall meet on the road i shall like, and whoever beholds me shall like 
 	  	  me; 
 i think whoever i see must be happy. 
 	 
 5 
 from this hour, freedom! 
 from this hour i ordain myself loos'd of limits and imaginary lines, 
 going where i list, my own master, total and absolute, 
 listening to others, and considering well what they say, 
 pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating, 
 gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that would hold me. 
 	 
 i inhale great draughts of space; 
 the east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are mine. 
 	 
 i am larger, better than i thought; 
 i did not know i held so much goodness. 
 	 
 all seems beautiful to me; 
 i can repeat over to men and women, you have done such good to me, i would do the same to 
 	  	  you. 
 	 
 	 
 i will recruit for myself and you as i go; 
 i will scatter myself among men and women as i go; 
 i will toss the new gladness and roughness among them; 
 whoever denies me, it shall not trouble me; 
 whoever accepts me, he or she shall be blessed, and shall bless me. 
 	 
 6 
 now if a thousand perfect men were to appear, it would not amaze me; 
 now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear'd, it would not astonish me. 
 	 
 now i see the secret of the making of the best persons, 
 it is to grow in the open air, and to eat and sleep with the earth. 
 	 
 here a great personal deed has room; 
 a great deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men, 
 its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law, and mocks all authority and all argument 
 	  against 
 	  it. 
 	 
 here is the test of wisdom; 
 wisdom is not finally tested in schools; 
 wisdom cannot be pass'd from one having it, to another not having it; 
 wisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof, 
 applies to all stages and objects and qualities, and is content, 
 is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the excellence of things; 
 something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes it out of the soul. 
 	 
 now i reëxamine philosophies and religions, 
 they may prove well in lecture rooms, yet not prove at all under the spacious clouds, and 
 	  	  along 
 	  the 
 	  landscape and flowing currents. 
 	 
 here is realization; 
 here is a man tallied he realizes here what he has in him; 
 the past, the future, majesty, love if they are vacant of you, you are vacant of them. 
 	 
 only the kernel of every object nourishes; 
 where is he who tears off the husks for you and me? 
 where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me? 
 	 
 here is adhesiveness it is not previously fashion'd it is apropos; 
 do you know what it is, as you pass, to be loved by strangers? 
 do you know the talk of those turning eye balls? 
 	 
 7 
 here is the efflux of the soul; 
 the efflux of the soul comes from within, through embower'd gates, ever provoking 
 	  	  questions: 
 these yearnings, why are they? these thoughts in the darkness, why are they? 
 why are there men and women that while they are nigh me, the sun light expands my blood? 
 why, when they leave me, do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank? 
 why are there trees i never walk under, but large and melodious thoughts descend upon me? 
 (i think they hang there winter and summer on those trees, and always drop fruit as i 
 	  	  pass;) 
 what is it i interchange so suddenly with strangers? 
 what with some driver, as i ride on the seat by his side? 
 what with some fisherman, drawing his seine by the shore, as i walk by, and pause? 
 what gives me to be free to a woman's or man's good will? what gives them to be free to 
 	  	  mine? 
 	 
 8 
 the efflux of the soul is happiness here is happiness; 
 i think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times; 
 now it flows unto us we are rightly charged. 
 	 
 here rises the fluid and attaching character; 
 the fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of man and woman; 
 (the herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day out of the roots of 
 	  themselves, 
 	  than it sprouts fresh and sweet continually out of itself.) 
 	 
 toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the love of young and old; 
 from it falls distill'd the charm that mocks beauty and attainments; 
 toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact. 
 	 
 9 
 allons! whoever you are, come travel with me! 
 traveling with me, you find what never tires. 
 	 
 the earth never tires; 
 the earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first nature is rude and incomprehensible 
 	  	  at 
 	  first; 
 	 
 be not discouraged keep on there are divine things, well envelop'd; 
 i swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell. 
 	 
 allons! we must not stop here! 
 however sweet these laid up stores however convenient this dwelling, we cannot remain 
 	  	  here; 
 however shelter'd this port, and however calm these waters, we must not anchor here; 
 however welcome the hospitality that surrounds us, we are permitted to receive it but a 
 	  	  little 
 	  while. 
 	 
 10 
 allons! the inducements shall be greater; 
 we will sail pathless and wild seas; 
 we will go where winds blow, waves dash, and the yankee clipper speeds by under full sail. 
 	 
 	 
 allons! with power, liberty, the earth, the elements! 
 health, defiance, gayety, self esteem, curiosity; 
 allons! from all formules! 
 from your formules, o bat eyed and materialistic priests! 
 	 
 the stale cadaver blocks up the passage the burial waits no longer. 
 	 
 allons! yet take warning! 
 he traveling with me needs the best blood, thews, endurance; 
 none may come to the trial, till he or she bring courage and health. 
 	 
 come not here if you have already spent the best of yourself; 
 only those may come, who come in sweet and determin'd bodies; 
 no diseas'd person no rum drinker or venereal taint is permitted here. 
 	 
 i and mine do not convince by arguments, similes, rhymes; 
 we convince by our presence. 
 	 
 11 
 listen! i will be honest with you; 
 i do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer rough new prizes; 
 these are the days that must happen to you: 
 	 
 you shall not heap up what is call'd riches, 
 you shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve, 
 you but arrive at the city to which you were destin'd you hardly settle yourself to 
 	  satisfaction, before you are call'd by an irresistible call to depart, 
 you shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those who remain behind you; 
 what beckonings of love you receive, you shall only answer with passionate kisses of 
 	  	  parting, 
 you shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reach'd hands toward you. 
 	 
 12 
 allons! after the great companions! and to belong to them! 
 they too are on the road! they are the swift and majestic men; they are the greatest 
 	  	  women. 
 over that which hinder'd them over that which retarded passing impediments large or small, 
 	 
 committers of crimes, committers of many beautiful virtues, 
 enjoyers of calms of seas, and storms of seas, 
 sailors of many a ship, walkers of many a mile of land, 
 habitués of many distant countries, habitués of far distant dwellings, 
 trusters of men and women, observers of cities, solitary toilers, 
 pausers and contemplators of tufts, blossoms, shells of the shore, 
 dancers at wedding dances, kissers of brides, tender helpers of children, bearers of 
 	  	  children, 
 	 
 soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves, lowerers down of coffins, 
 journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the years the curious years, each emerging from 
 	  	  that 
 	  which preceded it, 
 journeyers as with companions, namely, their own diverse phases, 
 forth steppers from the latent unrealized baby days, 
 journeyers gayly with their own youth journeyers with their bearded and well grain'd 
 	  	  manhood, 
 journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsurpass'd, content, 
 journeyers with their own sublime old age of manhood or womanhood, 
 old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of the universe, 
 old age, flowing free with the delicious near by freedom of death. 
 	 
 13 
 allons! to that which is endless, as it was beginningless, 
 to undergo much, tramps of days, rests of nights, 
 to merge all in the travel they tend to, and the days and nights they tend to, 
 again to merge them in the start of superior journeys; 
 to see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass it, 
 to conceive no time, however distant, but what you may reach it and pass it, 
 to look up or down no road but it stretches and waits for you however long, but it 
 	  	  stretches 
 	  and 
 	  waits for you; 
 to see no being, not god's or any, but you also go thither, 
 to see no possession but you may possess it enjoying all without labor or 
 	  	  purchase abstracting 
 	  the feast, yet not abstracting one particle of it; 
 to take the best of the farmer's farm and the rich man's elegant villa, and the chaste 
 	  blessings 
 	  of the well married couple, and the fruits of orchards and flowers of gardens, 
 to take to your use out of the compact cities as you pass through, 
 to carry buildings and streets with you afterward wherever you go, 
 to gather the minds of men out of their brains as you encounter them to gather the love 
 	  	  out of 
 	  their hearts, 
 to take your lovers on the road with you, for all that you leave them behind you, 
 to know the universe itself as a road as many roads as roads for traveling souls. 
 	 
 14 
 the soul travels; 
 the body does not travel as much as the soul; 
 the body has just as great a work as the soul, and parts away at last for the journeys of 
 	  	  the 
 	  soul. 
 	 
 	 
 all parts away for the progress of souls; 
 all religion, all solid things, arts, governments, all that was or is apparent upon this 
 	  	  globe 
 	  or 
 	  any globe, falls into niches and corners before the procession of souls along the grand 
 	  	  roads 
 	  of 
 	  the 
 	  universe. 
 	 
 of the progress of the souls of men and women along the grand roads of the universe, all 
 	  	  other 
 	  progress is the needed emblem and sustenance. 
 	 
 forever alive, forever forward, 
 stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad, turbulent, feeble, dissatisfied, 
 desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by men, rejected by men, 
 they go! they go! i know that they go, but i know not where they go; 
 but i know that they go toward the best toward something great. 
 	 
 15 
 allons! whoever you are! come forth! 
 you must not stay sleeping and dallying there in the house, though you built it, or though 
 	  	  it 
 	  has 
 	  been built for you. 
 	 
 allons! out of the dark confinement! 
 it is useless to protest i know all, and expose it. 
 	 
 behold, through you as bad as the rest, 
 through the laughter, dancing, dining, supping, of people, 
 inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of those wash'd and trimm'd faces, 
 behold a secret silent loathing and despair. 
 	 
 no husband, no wife, no friend, trusted to hear the confession; 
 another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and hiding it goes, 
 formless and wordless through the streets of the cities, polite and bland in the parlors, 
 in the cars of rail roads, in steamboats, in the public assembly, 
 home to the houses of men and women, at the table, in the bed room, everywhere, 
 smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death under the breast bones, hell 
 	  	  under 
 	  the 
 	  skull bones, 
 under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial flowers, 
 keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a syllable of itself, 
 speaking of anything else, but never of itself. 
 	 
 16 
 allons! through struggles and wars! 
 the goal that was named cannot be countermanded. 
 	 
 have the past struggles succeeded? 
 what has succeeded? yourself? your nation? nature? 
 now understand me well it is provided in the essence of things, that from any fruition of 
 	  success, 
 	  no matter what, shall come forth something to make a greater struggle necessary. 
 	 
 my call is the call of battle i nourish active rebellion; 
 he going with me must go well arm'd; 
 he going with me goes often with spare diet, poverty, angry enemies, desertions. 
 	 
 17 
 allons! the road is before us! 
 it is safe i have tried it my own feet have tried it well. 
 	 
 allons! be not detain'd! 
 let the paper remain on the desk unwritten, and the book on the shelf unopen'd! 
 let the tools remain in the workshop! let the money remain unearn'd! 
 let the school stand! mind not the cry of the teacher! 
 let the preacher preach in his pulpit! let the lawyer plead in the court, and the judge 
 	  	  expound 
 	  the 
 	  law. 
 	 
 mon enfant! i give you my hand! 
 i give you my love, more precious than money, 
 i give you myself, before preaching or law; 
 will you give me yourself? will you come travel with me? 
 shall we stick by each other as long as we live? 
 warble me now, for joy of lilac time, 
 sort me, o tongue and lips, for nature's sake, and sweet life's sake and 
 	  death's the same as life's, 
 souvenirs of earliest summer birds' eggs, and the first berries; 
 gather the welcome signs, (as children, with pebbles, or stringing shells;) 
 put in april and may the hylas croaking in the ponds the elastic air, 
 bees, butterflies, the sparrow with its simple notes, 
 blue bird, and darting swallow nor forget the high hole flashing his golden wings, 
 the tranquil sunny haze, the clinging smoke, the vapor, 
 spiritual, airy insects, humming on gossamer wings, 
 shimmer of waters, with fish in them the cerulean above; 
 all that is jocund and sparkling the brooks running, 
 the maple woods, the crisp february days, and the sugar making; 
 the robin, where he hops, bright eyed, brown breasted, 
 with musical clear call at sunrise, and again at sunset, 
 or flitting among the trees of the apple orchard, building the nest of his mate; 
 the melted snow of march the willow sending forth its yellow green sprouts; 
 	 for spring time is here! the summer is here! and what is this in it and from it? 
 thou, soul, unloosen'd the restlessness after i know not what; 
 come! let us lag here no longer let us be up and away! 
 o for another world! o if one could but fly like a bird! 
 o to escape to sail forth, as in a ship! 
 to glide with thee, o soul, o'er all, in all, as a ship o'er the waters! 
 	 gathering these hints, these preludes the blue sky, the grass, the morning 
 	  	  drops of 
 	  dew; 
 (with additional songs every spring will i now strike up additional songs, 
 nor ever again forget, these tender days, the chants of death as well as life;) 
 the lilac scent, the bushes, and the dark green, heart shaped leaves, 
 wood violets, the little delicate pale blossoms called innocence, 
 samples and sorts not for themselves alone, but for their atmosphere, 
 to tally, drench'd with them, tested by them, 
 cities and artificial life, and all their sights and scenes, 
 my mind henceforth, and all its meditations my recitatives, 
 my land, my age, my race, for once to serve in songs, 
 (sprouts, tokens ever of death indeed the same as life,) 
 to grace the bush i love to sing with the birds, 
 a warble for joy of lilac time. 
 1 
 or, from that sea of time, 
 spray, blown by the wind a double winrow drift of weeds and shells; 
 (o little shells, so curious convolute! so limpid cold and voiceless! 
 yet will you not, to the tympans of temples held, 
 murmurs and echoes still bring up eternity's music, faint and far, 
 wafted inland, sent from atlantica's rim strains for the soul of the prairies, 
 whisper'd reverberations chords for the ear of the west, joyously sounding 
 your tidings old, yet ever new and untranslatable;) 
 infinitessimals out of my life, and many a life, 
 (for not my life and years alone i give all, all i give;) 
 these thoughts and songs waifs from the deep here, cast high and dry, 
 wash'd on america's shores. 
 	 
 2 
 currents of starting a continent new, 
 overtures sent to the solid out of the liquid, 
 fusion of ocean and land tender and pensive waves, 
 (not safe and peaceful only waves rous'd and ominous too. 
 out of the depths, the storm's abysms who knows whence? death's waves, 
 raging over the vast, with many a broken spar and tatter'd sail.) 
 to get betimes in boston town, i rose this morning early; 
 here's a good place at the corner i must stand and see the show. 
 	 
 clear the way there, jonathan! 
 way for the president's marshal! way for the government cannon! 
 way for the federal foot and dragoons and the apparitions copiously tumbling. 
 	 
 i love to look on the stars and stripes i hope the fifes will play yankee doodle. 
 	 
 how bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops! 
 every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through boston town. 
 	 
 a fog follows antiques of the same come limping, 
 some appear wooden legged, and some appear bandaged and bloodless. 
 	 
 why this is indeed a show! it has called the dead out of the earth! 
 the old grave yards of the hills have hurried to see! 
 phantoms! phantoms countless by flank and rear! 
 cock'd hats of mothy mould! crutches made of mist! 
 arms in slings! old men leaning on young men's shoulders! 
 	 
 what troubles you, yankee phantoms? what is all this chattering of bare gums? 
 does the ague convulse your limbs? do you mistake your crutches for fire locks, and level 
 	  	  them? 
 	 
 	 
 if you blind your eyes with tears, you will not see the president's marshal; 
 if you groan such groans, you might balk the government cannon. 
 	 
 for shame, old maniacs! bring down those toss'd arms, and let your white hair be; 
 here gape your great grand sons their wives gaze at them from the windows, 
 see how well dress'd see how orderly they conduct themselves. 
 	 
 worse and worse! can't you stand it? are you retreating? 
 is this hour with the living too dead for you? 
 	 
 retreat then! pell mell! 
 to your graves! back! back to the hills, old limpers! 
 i do not think you belong here, anyhow. 
 	 
 but there is one thing that belongs here shall i tell you what it is, gentlemen of 
 	  	  boston? 
 	 
 i will whisper it to the mayor he shall send a committee to england; 
 they shall get a grant from the parliament, go with a cart to the royal vault haste! 
 	 
 dig out king george's coffin, unwrap him quick from the grave clothes, box up his 
 	  	  bones 
 	  for a 
 	  journey; 
 find a swift yankee clipper here is freight for you, black bellied clipper, 
 up with your anchor! shake out your sails! steer straight toward boston bay. 
 	 
 now call for the president's marshal again, bring out the government cannon, 
 fetch home the roarers from congress, make another procession, guard it with foot and 
 	  	  dragoons. 
 	 
 this centre piece for them: 
 look! all orderly citizens look from the windows, women! 
 	 
 the committee open the box, set up the regal ribs, glue those that will not stay, 
 clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the skull. 
 	 
 you have got your revenge, old buster! the crown is come to its own, and more than its 
 	  	  own. 
 	 
 stick your hands in your pockets, jonathan you are a made man from this day; 
 you are mighty cute and here is one of your bargains. 
 whispers of heavenly death, murmur'd i hear; 
 labial gossip of night sibilant chorals; 
 footsteps gently ascending mystical breezes, wafted soft and low; 
 ripples of unseen rivers tides of a current, flowing, forever flowing; 
 (or is it the plashing of tears? the measureless waters of human tears?) 
 	 
 i see, just see, skyward, great cloud masses; 
 mournfully, slowly they roll, silently swelling and mixing; 
 with, at times, a half dimm'd, sadden'd, far off star, 
 appearing and disappearing. 
 	 
 (some parturition, rather some solemn, immortal birth: 
 on the frontiers, to eyes impenetrable, 
 some soul is passing over.) 
 unfolded out of the folds of the woman, man comes unfolded, and is always to 
 	  come unfolded; 
 unfolded only out of the superbest woman of the earth, is to come the superbest 
 	  man of the earth; 
 unfolded out of the friendliest woman, is to come the friendliest man; 
 unfolded only out of the perfect body of a woman, can a man be form'd of 
 	  perfect body; 
 unfolded only out of the inimitable poem of the woman, can come the poems of 
 	  man (only thence have my poems come;) 
 unfolded out of the strong and arrogant woman i love, only thence can appear the 
 	  strong and arrogant man i love; 
 unfolded by brawny embraces from the well muscled woman i love, only thence come 
 	  the brawny embraces of the man; 
 unfolded out of the folds of the woman's brain, come all the folds of the 
 	  man's brain, duly obedient; 
 unfolded out of the justice of the woman, all justice is unfolded; 
 unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman is all sympathy: 
 a man is a great thing upon the earth, and through eternity but every jot 
 	  of the greatness of man is unfolded out of woman, 
 first the man is shaped in the woman, he can then be shaped in himself. 
 nations ten thousand years before these states, and many times ten thousand years before 
 	  	  these 
 	  states; 
 garner'd clusters of ages, that men and women like us grew up and travel'd their 
 	  course, and pass'd on; 
 what vast built cities what orderly republics what pastoral tribes and nomads; 
 what histories, rulers, heroes, perhaps transcending all others; 
 what laws, customs, wealth, arts, traditions; 
 what sort of marriage what costumes what physiology and phrenology; 
 what of liberty and slavery among them what they thought of death and the soul; 
 who were witty and wise who beautiful and poetic who brutish and 
 	  	  undevelop'd; 
 not a mark, not a record remains and yet all remains. 
 	 
 o i know that those men and women were not for nothing, any more than we are for nothing; 
 i know that they belong to the scheme of the world every bit as much as we now belong to 
 	  	  it, 
 	  and as all will henceforth belong to it. 
 	 
 afar they stand yet near to me they stand, 
 some with oval countenances, learn'd and calm, 
 some naked and savage some like huge collections of insects, 
 some in tents herdsmen, patriarchs, tribes, horsemen, 
 some prowling through woods some living peaceably on farms, laboring, reaping, 
 	  	  filling 
 	  barns, 
 some traversing paved avenues, amid temples, palaces, factories, libraries, shows, courts, 
 	  theatres, wonderful monuments. 
 	 
 are those billions of men really gone? 
 are those women of the old experience of the earth gone? 
 do their lives, cities, arts, rest only with us? 
 did they achieve nothing for good, for themselves? 
 	 
 i believe of all those billions of men and women that fill'd the unnamed lands, every 
 	  	  one 
 	  exists this hour, here or elsewhere, invisible to us, in exact proportion to what he or 
 	  	  she 
 	  grew from in life, and out of what he or she did, felt, became, loved, sinn'd, in 
 	  	  life. 
 	 
 i believe that was not the end of those nations, or any person of them, any more than this 
 	  shall be the end of my nation, or of me; 
 of their languages, governments, marriage, literature, products, games, wars, manners, 
 	  	  crimes, 
 	  prisons, slaves, heroes, poets, i suspect their results curiously await in the yet unseen 
 	  world counterparts of what accrued to them in the seen world. 
 i suspect i shall meet them there, 
 i suspect i shall there find each old particular of those unnamed lands. 
 1 
 thought of the infinite the all! 
 be thou my god. 
 	 
 2 
 lover divine, and perfect comrade! 
 waiting, content, invisible yet, but certain, 
 be thou my god. 
 	 
 3 
 thou thou, the ideal man! 
 fair, able, beautiful, content, and loving, 
 complete in body, and dilate in spirit, 
 be thou my god. 
 	 
 4 
 o death (for life has served its turn;) 
 opener and usher to the heavenly mansion! 
 be thou my god. 
 	 
 5 
 aught, aught, of mightiest, best, i see, conceive, or know, 
 (to break the stagnant tie thee, thee to free, o soul,) 
 be thou my god. 
 	 
 6 
 or thee, old cause, when'er advancing; 
 all great ideas, the races' aspirations, 
 all that exalts, releases thee, my soul! 
 all heroisms, deeds of rapt enthusiasts, 
 be ye my gods! 
 	 
 7 
 or time and space! 
 or shape of earth, divine and wondrous! 
 or shape in i myself or some fair shape, i, viewing, worship, 
 or lustrous orb of sun, or star by night: 
 be ye my gods. 
 from paumanock starting, i fly like a bird, 
 around and around to soar, to sing the idea of all; 
 to the north betaking myself, to sing there arctic songs, 
 to kanada, till i absorb kanada in myself to michigan then, 
 to wisconsin, iowa, minnesota, to sing their songs, (they are inimitable;) 
 then to ohio and indiana to sing theirs to missouri and kansas and arkansas, to sing 
 	  theirs, 
 to tennessee and kentucky to the carolinas and georgia, to sing theirs, 
 to texas, and so along up toward california, to roam accepted everywhere; 
 to sing first, (to the tap of the war drum, if need be,) 
 the idea of all of the western world, one and inseparable. 
 and then the song of each member of these states. 
 1 
 after all, not to create only, or found only, 
 but to bring, perhaps from afar, what is already founded, 
 to give it our own identity, average, limitless, free; 
 to fill the gross, the torpid bulk with vital religious fire; 
 not to repel or destroy, so much as accept, fuse, rehabilitate; 
 to obey, as well as command to follow, more than to lead; 
 these also are the lessons of our new world; 
 	 while how little the new, after all how much the old, old world! 
 	 
 long, long, long, has the grass been growing, 
 long and long has the rain been falling, 
 long has the globe been rolling round. 
 	 
 2 
 come, muse, migrate from greece and ionia; 
 cross out, please, those immensely overpaid accounts, 
 that matter of troy, and achilles' wrath, and eneas', odysseus' wanderings; 
 placard â€œremovedâ€ and â€œto letâ€ on the rocks of your snowy 
 	  	  parnassus; 
 repeat at jerusalem place the notice high on jaffa's gate, and on mount moriah; 
 the same on the walls of your gothic european cathedrals, and german, french and spanish 
 	  castles; 
 for know a better, fresher, busier sphere a wide, untried domain awaits, demands you. 
 	 
 3 
 responsive to our summons, 
 or rather to her long nurs'd inclination, 
 join'd with an irresistible, natural gravitation, 
 	 
 she comes! this famous female as was indeed to be expected; 
 (for who, so ever youthful, 'cute and handsome, would wish to stay in mansions such as 
 	  	  those, 
 	 
 when offer'd quarters with all the modern improvements, 
 with all the fun that 's going and all the best society?) 
 	 
 she comes! i hear the rustling of her gown; 
 i scent the odor of her breath's delicious fragrance; 
 i mark her step divine her curious eyes a turning, rolling, 
 upon this very scene. 
 	 
 the dame of dames! can i believe, then, 
 those ancient temples classic, and castles strong and feudalistic, 
 could none of them restrain her? 
 nor shades of virgil and dante nor myriad memories, poems, old associations, magnetize and 
 	  hold on to her? 
 but that she 's left them all and here? 
 	 
 yes, if you will allow me to say so, 
 i, my friends, if you do not, can plainly see her, 
 the same undying soul of earth's, activity's, beauty's, heroism's expression, 
 out from her evolutions hither come submerged the strata of her former themes, 
 hidden and cover'd by to day's foundation of to day's; 
 ended, deceas'd, through time, her voice by castaly's fountain; 
 silent through time the broken lipp'd sphynx in egypt silent those century baffling tombs; 
 	 
 closed for aye the epics of asia's, europe's helmeted warriors; 
 calliope's call for ever closed clio, melpomene, thalia closed and dead; 
 seal'd the stately rhythmus of una and oriana ended the quest of the holy graal; 
 jerusalem a handful of ashes blown by the wind extinct; 
 the crusaders' streams of shadowy, midnight troops, sped with the sunrise; 
 amadis, tancred, utterly gone charlemagne, roland, oliver gone, 
 palmerin, ogre, departed vanish'd the turrets that usk reflected, 
 arthur vanish'd with all his knights merlin and lancelot and galahad all 
 	  gone dissolv'd utterly, like an exhalation; 
 pass'd! pass'd! for us, for ever pass'd! that once so mighty world now void, inanimate, 
 	  phantom world! 
 	 
 embroider'd, dazzling world! with all its gorgeous legends, myths, 
 its kings and barons proud its priests, and warlike lords, and courtly dames; 
 pass'd to its charnel vault laid on the shelf coffin'd, with crown and armor on, 
 blazon'd with shakspeare's purple page, 
 and dirged by tennyson's sweet sad rhyme. 
 	 
 i say i see, my friends, if you do not, the animus of all that world, 
 escaped, bequeath'd, vital, fugacious as ever, leaving those dead remains, and now this 
 	  	  spot 
 	  approaching, filling; 
 	 and i can hear what maybe you do not a terrible aesthetical commotion, 
 with howling, desperate gulp of â€œflowerâ€ and â€œbower,â€ 
 with â€œsonnet to matilda's eyebrowâ€ quite, quite frantic; 
 with gushing, sentimental reading circles turn'd to ice or stone; 
 with many a squeak, (in metre choice,) from boston, new york, philadelphia, london; 
 as she, the illustrious emigré, (having, it is true, in her day, although the same, 
 	  	  changed, 
 	  journey'd considerable,) 
 making directly for this rendezvous vigorously clearing a path for herself striding 
 	  	  through 
 	  the confusion, 
 by thud of machinery and shrill steam whistle undismay'd, 
 bluff'd not a bit by drain pipe, gasometers, artificial fertilizers, 
 smiling and pleased, with palpable intent to stay, 
 she 's here, install'd amid the kitchen ware! 
 	 
 4 
 but hold don't i forget my manners? 
 to introduce the stranger (what else indeed have i come for?) to thee, columbia: 
 in liberty's name, welcome, immortal! clasp hands, 
 and ever henceforth sisters dear be both. 
 	 
 fear not, o muse! truly new ways and days receive, surround you, 
 (i candidly confess, a queer, queer race, of novel fashion,) 
 and yet the same old human race the same within, without, 
 faces and hearts the same feelings the same yearnings the same, 
 the same old love beauty and use the same. 
 	 
 5 
 we do not blame thee, elder world nor separate ourselves from thee: 
 (would the son separate himself from the father?) 
 looking back on thee seeing thee to thy duties, grandeurs, through past ages bending, 
 	  building, 
 we build to ours to day. 
 	 
 mightier than egypt's tombs, 
 fairer than grecia's, roma's temples, 
 prouder than milan's statued, spired cathedral, 
 more picturesque than rhenish castle keeps, 
 we plan, even now, to raise, beyond them all, 
 thy great cathedral, sacred industry no tomb, 
 a keep for life for practical invention. 
 	 
 as in a waking vision, 
 e'en while i chant, i see it rise i scan and prophesy outside and in, 
 its manifold ensemble. 
 	 
 6 
 around a palace, 
 loftier, fairer, ampler than any yet, 
 earth's modern wonder, history's seven outstripping, 
 high rising tier on tier, with glass and iron faã§ades. 
 	 
 gladdening the sun and sky enhued in cheerfulest hues, 
 bronze, lilac, robin's egg, marine and crimson, 
 over whose golden roof shall flaunt, beneath thy banner, freedom, 
 the banners of the states, the flags of every land, 
 a brood of lofty, fair, but lesser palaces shall cluster. 
 	 
 somewhere within the walls of all, 
 shall all that forwards perfect human life be started, 
 tried, taught, advanced, visibly exhibited. 
 	 
 here shall you trace in flowing operation, 
 in every state of practical, busy movement, 
 the rills of civilization. 
 	 
 materials here, under your eye, shall change their shape, as if by magic; 
 the cotton shall be pick'd almost in the very field, 
 shall be dried, clean'd, ginn'd, baled, spun into thread and cloth, before you: 
 you shall see hands at work at all the old processes, and all the new ones; 
 you shall see the various grains, and how flour is made, and then bread baked by the 
 	  	  bakers; 
 you shall see the crude ores of california and nevada passing on and on till they become 
 	  bullion; 
 you shall watch how the printer sets type, and learn what a composing stick is; 
 you shall mark, in amazement, the hoe press whirling its cylinders, shedding the printed 
 	  	  leaves 
 	  steady and fast: 
 the photograph, model, watch, pin, nail, shall be created before you. 
 	 
 in large calm halls, a stately museum shall teach you the infinite, solemn lessons of 
 	  	  minerals; 
 	 
 in another, woods, plants, vegetation shall be illustrated in another animals, animal life 
 	  and development. 
 	 
 one stately house shall be the music house; 
 others for other arts learning, the sciences, shall all be here; 
 none shall be slighted none but shall here be honor'd, help'd, exampled. 
 	 
 7 
 this, this and these, america, shall be your pyramids and obelisks, 
 your alexandrian pharos, gardens of babylon, 
 your temple at olympia. 
 	 
 the male and female many laboring not, 
 shall ever here confront the laboring many, 
 with precious benefits to both glory to all, 
 to thee, america and thee, eternal muse. 
 	 
 and here shall ye inhabit, powerful matrons! 
 in your vast state, vaster than all the old; 
 echoed through long, long centuries to come, 
 to sound of different, prouder songs, with stronger themes, 
 practical, peaceful life the people's life the people themselves, 
 lifted, illumin'd, bathed in peace elate, secure in peace. 
 	 
 8 
 away with themes of war! away with war itself! 
 hence from my shuddering sight, to never more return, that show of blacken'd, mutilated 
 	  corpses! 
 that hell unpent, and raid of blood fit for wild tigers, or for lop tongued wolves not 
 	  reasoning men! 
 and in its stead speed industry's campaigns! 
 with thy undaunted armies, engineering! 
 thy pennants, labor, loosen'd to the breeze! 
 thy bugles sounding loud and clear! 
 	 
 away with old romance! 
 away with novels, plots, and plays of foreign courts! 
 away with love verses, sugar'd in rhyme the intrigues, amours of idlers, 
 fitted for only banquets of the night, where dancers to late music slide; 
 the unhealthy pleasures, extravagant dissipations of the few, 
 with perfumes, heat and wine, beneath the dazzling chandeliers. 
 	 
 9 
 to you, ye reverent, sane sisters, 
 to this resplendent day, the present scene, 
 these eyes and ears that like some broad parterre bloom up around, before me, 
 i raise a voice for far superber themes for poets and for art, 
 to exalt the present and the real, 
 to teach the average man the glory of his daily walk and trade, 
 to sing, in songs, how exercise and chemical life are never to be baffled; 
 boldly to thee, america, to day! and thee, immortal muse! 
 to practical, manual work, for each and all to plough, hoe, dig, 
 to plant and tend the tree, the berry, the vegetables, flowers, 
 for every man to see to it that he really do something for every woman too; 
 to use the hammer, and the saw, (rip or cross cut,) 
 to cultivate a turn for carpentering, plastering, painting, 
 to work as tailor, tailoress, nurse, hostler, porter, 
 to invent a little something ingenious to aid the washing, cooking, cleaning, 
 and hold it no disgrace to take a hand at them themselves. 
 	 
 i say i bring thee, muse, to day and here, 
 all occupations, duties broad and close, 
 toil, healthy toil and sweat, endless, without cessation, 
 the old, old general burdens, interests, joys, 
 the family, parentage, childhood, husband and wife, 
 the house comforts the house itself, and all its belongings, 
 food and its preservations chemistry applied to it; 
 whatever forms the average, strong, complete, sweet blooded man or woman the perfect, 
 	  	  longeve 
 	  personality, 
 and helps its present life to health and happiness and shapes its soul, 
 for the eternal real life to come. 
 	 
 with latest materials, works, 
 steam power, the great express lines, gas, petroleum, 
 these triumphs of our time, the atlantic's delicate cable, 
 the pacific railroad, the suez canal, the mont cenis tunnel; 
 science advanced, in grandeur and reality, analyzing every thing, 
 this world all spann'd with iron rails with lines of steamships 
 threading every sea, 
 our own rondure, the current globe i bring. 
 	 
 10 
 and thou, high towering one america! 
 thy swarm of offspring towering high yet higher thee, above all towering, 
 with victory on thy left, and at thy right hand law; 
 thou union, holding all fusing, absorbing, tolerating all, 
 thee, ever thee, i bring. 
 	 
 thou also thou, a world! 
 with all thy wide geographies, manifold, different, distant, 
 rounding by thee in one one common orbic language, 
 one common indivisible destiny and union. 
 	 
 11 
 and by the spells which ye vouchsafe, 
 to those, your ministers in earnest, 
 i here personify and call my themes, 
 to make them pass before ye. 
 	 
 behold, america! (and thou, ineffable guest and sister!) 
 for thee come trooping up thy waters and thy lands: 
 behold! thy fields and farms, thy far off woods and mountains, 
 as in procession coming. 
 	 
 behold! the sea itself! 
 and on its limitless, heaving breast, thy ships: 
 see! where their white sails, bellying in the wind, speckle the green and blue! 
 see! thy steamers coming and going, steaming in or out of port! 
 see! dusky and undulating, their long pennants of smoke! 
 	 
 behold, in oregon, far in the north and west, 
 or in maine, far in the north and east, thy cheerful axemen, 
 wielding all day their axes! 
 	 
 behold, on the lakes, thy pilots at their wheels thy oarsmen! 
 behold how the ash writhes under those muscular arms! 
 	 
 there by the furnace, and there by the anvil, 
 behold thy sturdy blacksmiths, swinging their sledges; 
 overhand so steady overhand they turn and fall, with joyous clank, 
 like a tumult of laughter. 
 	 
 behold! (for still the procession moves,) 
 behold, mother of all, thy countless sailors, boatmen, coasters! 
 the myriads of thy young and old mechanics! 
 mark mark the spirit of invention everywhere thy rapid patents, 
 thy continual workshops, foundries, risen or rising; 
 see, from their chimneys, how the tall flame fires stream! 
 	 
 mark, thy interminable farms, north, south, 
 thy wealthy daughter states, eastern, and western, 
 the varied products of ohio, pennsylvania, missouri, georgia, texas, and the rest; 
 thy limitless crops grass, wheat, sugar, corn, rice, hemp, hops, 
 thy barns all fill'd thy endless freight trains, and thy bulging store houses, 
 the grapes that ripen on thy vines the apples in thy orchards, 
 thy incalculable lumber, beef, pork, potatoes thy coal thy gold and silver, 
 the inexhaustible iron in thy mines. 
 	 
 12 
 all thine, o sacred union! 
 ship, farm, shop, barns, factories, mines, 
 city and state north, south, item and aggregate, 
 we dedicate, dread mother, all to thee! 
 	 
 protectress absolute, thou! bulwark of all! 
 for well we know that while thou givest each and all, (generous as god,) 
 without thee, neither all nor each, nor land, home, 
 ship, nor mine nor any here, this day, secure, 
 nor aught, nor any day secure. 
 	 
 13 
 and thou, thy emblem, waving over all! 
 delicate beauty! a word to thee, (it may be salutary;) 
 remember, thou hast not always been, as here to day, so comfortably ensovereign'd; 
 in other scenes than these have i observ'd thee, flag; 
 not quite so trim and whole, and freshly blooming, in folds of stainless silk; 
 but i have seen thee, bunting, to tatters torn, upon thy splinter'd staff, 
 or clutch'd to some young color bearer's breast, with desperate hands, 
 savagely struggled for, for life or death fought over long, 
 'mid cannon's thunder crash, and many a curse, and groan and yell and rifle volleys 
 	  cracking sharp, 
 and moving masses, as wild demons surging and lives as nothing risk'd, 
 for thy mere remnant, grimed with dirt and smoke, and sopp'd in blood; 
 for sake of that, my beauty and that thou might'st dally, as now, secure up there, 
 many a good man have i seen go under. 
 	 
 14 
 now here, and these, and hence, in peace all thine, o flag! 
 and here, and hence, for thee, o universal muse! and thou for them! 
 and here and hence, o union, all the work and workmen thine! 
 the poets, women, sailors, soldiers, farmers, miners, students thine! 
 none separate from thee henceforth one only, we and thou; 
 (for the blood of the children what is it only the blood maternal? 
 and lives and works what are they all at last except the roads to faith and death?) 
 	 
 while we rehearse our measureless wealth, it is for thee, dear mother! 
 we own it all and several to day indissoluble in thee; 
 	 think not our chant, our show, merely for products gross, or lucre it is for thee, the 
 	  soul, electric, spiritual! 
 our farms, inventions, crops, we own in thee! cities and states in thee! 
 our freedom all in thee! our very lives in thee! 
 1 
 starting from fish shape paumanok, where i was born, 
 well begotten, and rais'd by a perfect mother; 
 after roaming many lands lover of populous pavements; 
 dweller in mannahatta, my city or on southern savannas; 
 or a soldier camp'd, or carrying my knapsack and gun or a miner in 
 	  california; 
 or rude in my home in dakota's woods, my diet meat, my drink from the 
 	  spring; 
 or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep recess, 
 far from the clank of crowds, intervals passing, rapt and happy; 
 aware of the fresh free giver, the flowing missouri aware of mighty 
 	  niagara; 
 aware of the buffalo herds, grazing the plains the hirsute and 
 	  strong breasted bull; 
 of earth, rocks, fifth month flowers, experienced stars, rain, snow, my 
 	  amaze; 
 having studied the mocking bird's tones, and the mountainhawk's, 
 and heard at dusk the unrival'd one, the hermit thrush from the 
 	  swamp cedars, 
 solitary, singing in the west, i strike up for a new world. 
 	 
 2victory, union, faith, identity, time, 
 the indissoluble compacts, riches, mystery, 
 eternal progress, the kosmos, and the modern reports. 
 	 
 this, then, is life; 
 here is what has come to the surface after so many throes and convulsions. 
 	 
 how curious! how real! 
 underfoot the divine soil overhead the sun. 
 	 
 see, revolving, the globe; 
 the ancestor continents, away, group'd together; 
 the present and future continents, north and south, with the isthmus between. 
 	 
 see, vast, trackless spaces; 
 as in a dream, they change, they swiftly fill; 
 countless masses debouch upon them; 
 they are now cover'd with the foremost people, arts, institutions, known. 
 	 
 see, projected, through time, 
 for me, an audience interminable. 
 	 
 with firm and regular step they wend they never stop, 
 successions of men, americanos, a hundred millions; 
 one generation playing its part, and passing on; 
 another generation playing its part, and passing on in its turn, 
 with faces turn'd sideways or backward towards me, to listen, 
 with eyes retrospective towards me, 
 	 
 3americanos! conquerors! marches humanitarian; 
 foremost! century marches! libertad! masses! 
 for you a programme of chants. 
 	 
 chants of the prairies; 
 chants of the long running mississippi, and down to the mexican sea; 
 chants of ohio, indiana, illinois, iowa, wisconsin and minnesota; 
 chants going forth from the centre, from kansas, and thence, equi distant, 
 shooting in pulses of fire, ceaseless, to vivify all. 
 	 
 4in the year 80 of the states, 
 my tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this soil, this air, 
 born here of parents born here, from parents the same, and their parents the 
 	  same, 
 i, now thirty six years old, in perfect health, begin, 
 hoping to cease not till death. 
 	 
 creeds and schools in abeyance, 
 (retiring back a while, sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,) 
 i harbor, for good or bad i permit to speak, at every hazard, 
 nature now without check, with original energy. 
 	 
 5take my leaves, america! take them, south, and take them, north! 
 make welcome for them everywhere, for they are your own offspring; 
 surround them, east and west! for they would surround you; 
 and you precedents! connect lovingly with them, for they connect lovingly with 
 	  you. 
 	 
 i conn'd old times; 
 i sat studying at the feet of the great masters: 
 now, if eligible, o that the great masters might return and study me! 
 	 
 in the name of these states, shall i scorn the antique? 
 why these are the children of the antique, to justify it. 
 	 
 6dead poets, philosophs, priests, 
 martyrs, artists, inventors, governments long since, 
 language shapers, on other shores, 
 nations once powerful, now reduced, withdrawn, or desolate, 
 i dare not proceed till i respectfully credit what you have left, wafted hither: 
 	 
 i have perused it own it is admirable, (moving awhile among it;) 
 think nothing can ever be greater nothing can ever deserve more than it 
 	  deserves; 
 regarding it all intently a long while then dismissing it, 
 i stand in my place, with my own day, here. 
 	 
 here lands female and male; 
 here the heir ship and heiress ship of the world here the flame of 
 	  materials; 
 here spirituality, the translatress, the openly avow'd, 
 the ever tending, the finale of visible forms; 
 the satisfier, after due long waiting, now advancing, 
 yes, here comes my mistress, the soul. 
 	 
 7the soul: 
 forever and forever longer than soil is brown and solid longer than 
 	  water ebbs and flows. 
 	 
 i will make the poems of materials, for i think they are to be the most 
 	  spiritual poems; 
 and i will make the poems of my body and of mortality, 
 for i think i shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul, and of 
 	  immortality. 
 	 
 i will make a song for these states, that no one state may under any 
 	  circumstances be subjected to another state; 
 and i will make a song that there shall be comity by day and by night between 
 	  all the states, and between any two of them: 
 and i will make a song for the ears of the president, full of weapons with 
 	  menacing points, 
 and behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces: 
 	 and a song make i, of the one form'd out of all; 
 the fang'd and glittering one whose head is over all; 
 resolute, warlike one, including and over all; 
 (however high the head of any else, that head is over all.) 
 	 
 i will acknowledge contemporary lands; 
 i will trail the whole geography of the globe, and salute courteously every city 
 	  large and small; 
 and employments! i will put in my poems, that with you is heroism, upon land and 
 	  sea; 
 and i will report all heroism from an american point of view. 
 	 
 i will sing the song of companionship; 
 i will show what alone must finally compact these; 
 i believe these are to found their own ideal of manly love, indicating it in me; 
 	 
 i will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were threatening to 
 	  consume me; 
 i will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering fires; 
 i will give them complete abandonment; 
 i will write the evangel poem of comrades, and of love; 
 (for who but i should understand love, with all its sorrow and joy? 
 and who but i should be the poet of comrades?) 
 	 
 8i am the credulous man of qualities, ages, races; 
 i advance from the people in their own spirit; 
 here is what sings unrestricted faith. 
 	 
 omnes! omnes! let others ignore what they may; 
 i make the poem of evil also i commemorate that part also; 
 i am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation is and i say there is 
 	  in fact no evil; 
 (or if there is, i say it is just as important to you, to the land, or to me, as 
 	  anything else.) 
 	 
 i too, following many, and follow'd by many, inaugurate a religion i 
 	  descend into the arena; 
 (it may be i am destin'd to utter the loudest cries there, the 
 	  winner's pealing shouts; 
 who knows? they may rise from me yet, and soar above every thing.) 
 	 
 each is not for its own sake; 
 i say the whole earth, and all the stars in the sky, are for religion's 
 	  sake. 
 	 
 i say no man has ever yet been half devout enough; 
 none has ever yet adored or worship'd half enough; 
 none has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how certain the future is. 
 	 
 	 
 i say that the real and permanent grandeur of these states must be their 
 	  religion; 
 otherwise there is no real and permanent grandeur: 
 (nor character, nor life worthy the name, without religion; 
 nor land, nor man or woman, without religion.) 
 	 
 9what are you doing, young man? 
 are you so earnest so given up to literature, science, art, amours? 
 these ostensible realities, politics, points? 
 your ambition or business, whatever it may be? 
 	 
 it is well against such i say not a word i am their poet also; 
 but behold! such swiftly subside burnt up for religion's sake; 
 for not all matter is fuel to heat, impalpable flame, the essential life of the 
 	  earth, 
 any more than such are to religion. 
 	 
 10what do you seek, so pensive and silent? 
 what do you need, camerado? 
 dear son! do you think it is love? 
 	 
 listen, dear son listen, america, daughter or son! 
 it is a painful thing to love a man or woman to excess and yet it 
 	  satisfies it is great; 
 but there is something else very great it makes the whole coincide; 
 it, magnificent, beyond materials, with continuous hands, sweeps and provides 
 	  for all. 
 	 
 11know you! solely to drop in the earth the germs of a greater religion, 
 the following chants, each for its kind, i sing. 
 	 
 my comrade! 
 for you, to share with me, two greatnesses and a third one, rising 
 	  inclusive and more resplendent, 
 the greatness of love and democracy and the greatness of religion. 
 	 
 melange mine own! the unseen and the seen; 
 mysterious ocean where the streams empty; 
 prophetic spirit of materials shifting and flickering around me; 
 living beings, identities, now doubtless near us, in the air, that we know not 
 	  of; 
 contact daily and hourly that will not release me; 
 these selecting these, in hints, demanded of me. 
 	 
 not he, with a daily kiss, onward from childhood kissing me, 
 has winded and twisted around me that which holds me to him, 
 any more than i am held to the heavens, to the spiritual world, 
 and to the identities of the gods, my lovers, faithful and true, 
 after what they have done to me, suggesting themes. 
 	 
 o such themes! equalities! 
 o amazement of things! o divine average! 
 o warblings under the sun usher'd, as now, or at noon, or setting! 
 o strain, musical, flowing through ages now reaching hither! 
 i take to your reckless and composite chords i add to them, and cheerfully 
 	  pass them forward. 
 	 
 12as i have walk'd in alabama my morning walk, 
 i have seen where the she bird, the mocking bird, sat on her nest in the briers, 
 	  hatching her brood. 
 	 
 i have seen the he bird also; 
 i have paused to hear him, near at hand, inflating his throat, and joyfully 
 	  singing. 
 	 
 and while i paused, it came to me that what he really sang for was not there 
 	  only, 
 nor for his mate, nor himself only, nor all sent back by the echoes; 
 but subtle, clandestine, away beyond, 
 a charge transmitted, and gift occult, for those being born. 
 	 
 13democracy! 
 near at hand to you a throat is now inflating itself and joyfully singing. 
 	 
 ma femme! 
 for the brood beyond us and of us, 
 for those who belong here, and those to come, 
 i, exultant, to be ready for them, will now shake out carols stronger and 
 	  haughtier than have ever yet been heard upon earth. 
 	 
 i will make the songs of passion, to give them their way, 
 and your songs, outlaw'd offenders for i scan you with kindred eyes, 
 	  and carry you with me the same as any. 
 	 
 i will make the true poem of riches, 
 to earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres, and goes forward, and is not 
 	  dropt by death. 
 	 
 i will effuse egotism, and show it underlying all and i will be the bard of 
 	  personality; 
 and i will show of male and female that either is but the equal of the other; 
 and sexual organs and acts! do you concentrate in me for i am 
 	  determin'd to tell you with courageous clear voice, to prove you 
 	  illustrious; 
 and i will show that there is no imperfection in the present and can be 
 	  none in the future; 
 and i will show that whatever happens to anybody, it may be turn'd to 
 	  beautiful results and i will show that nothing can happen more beautiful 
 	  than death; 
 and i will thread a thread through my poems that time and events are compact, 
 and that all the things of the universe are perfect miracles, each as profound 
 	  as any. 
 	 
 i will not make poems with reference to parts; 
 but i will make leaves, poems, poemets, songs, says, thoughts with reference to 
 	  ensemble: 
 and i will not sing with reference to a day, but with reference to all days; 
 and i will not make a poem, nor the least part of a poem, but has reference to 
 	  the soul; 
 (because, having look'd at the objects of the universe, i find there is no 
 	  one, nor any particle of one, but has reference to the soul.) 
 	 
 14was somebody asking to see the soul? 
 see! your own shape and countenance persons, substances, beasts, the trees, 
 	  the running rivers, the rocks and sands. 
 	 
 all hold spiritual joys, and afterwards loosen them: 
 how can the real body ever die, and be buried? 
 	 
 of your real body, and any man's or woman's real body, 
 item for item, it will elude the hands of the corpse cleaners, and pass to 
 	  fitting spheres, 
 carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the moment of death. 
 	 
 not the types set up by the printer return their impression, the meaning, the 
 	  main concern, 
 any more than a man's substance and life, or a woman's substance and 
 	  life, return in the body and the soul, 
 indifferently before death and after death. 
 	 
 behold! the body includes and is the meaning, the main concern and includes 
 	  and is the soul; 
 whoever you are! how superb and how divine is your body, or any part of it. 
 	 
 15whoever you are! to you endless announcements. 
 	 
 daughter of the lands, did you wait for your poet? 
 did you wait for one with a flowing mouth and indicative hand? 
 	 
 toward the male of the states, and toward the female of the states, 
 live words words to the lands. 
 	 
 o the lands! interlink'd, food yielding lands! 
 land of coal and iron! land of gold! lands of cotton, sugar, rice! 
 land of wheat, beef, pork! land of wool and hemp! land of the apple and grape! 
 land of the pastoral plains, the grass fields of the world! land of those 
 	  sweet air'd interminable plateaus! 
 land of the herd, the garden, the healthy house of adobie! 
 lands where the northwest columbia winds, and where the southwest colorado 
 	  winds! 
 land of the eastern chesapeake! land of the delaware! 
 land of ontario, erie, huron, michigan! 
 land of the old thirteen! massachusetts land! land of vermont and connecticut! 
 land of the ocean shores! land of sierras and peaks! 
 land of boatmen and sailors! fishermen's land! 
 inextricable lands! the clutch'd together! the passionate ones! 
 the side by side! the elder and younger brothers! the bony limb'd! 
 the great women's land! the feminine! the experienced sisters and the 
 	  inexperienced sisters! 
 far breath'd land! arctic braced! mexican breez'd! the diverse! the 
 	  compact! 
 the pennsylvanian! the virginian! the double carolinian! 
 o all and each well loved by me! my intrepid nations! o i at any rate include 
 	  you all with perfect love! 
 i cannot be discharged from you! not from one, any sooner than another! 
 o death! o for all that, i am yet of you, unseen, this hour, with irrepressible 
 	  love, 
 walking new england, a friend, a traveler, 
 splashing my bare feet in the edge of the summer ripples, on paumanok's 
 	  sands, 
 crossing the prairies dwelling again in chicago dwelling in every 
 	  town, 
 observing shows, births, improvements, structures, arts, 
 listening to the orators and the oratresses in public halls, 
 of and through the states, as during life each man and woman my neighbor, 
 the louisianian, the georgian, as near to me, and i as near to him and her, 
 the mississippian and arkansian yet with me and i yet with any of them; 
 yet upon the plains west of the spinal river yet in my house of adobie, 
 yet returning eastward yet in the sea side state, or in maryland, 
 yet kanadian, cheerily braving the winter the snow and ice welcome to me, 
 yet a true son either of maine, or of the granite state, or of the narragansett 
 	  bay state, or of the empire state; 
 yet sailing to other shores to annex the same yet welcoming every new 
 	  brother; 
 hereby applying these leaves to the new ones, from the hour they unite with the 
 	  old ones; 
 coming among the new ones myself, to be their companion and equal coming 
 	  personally to you now; 
 enjoining you to acts, characters, spectacles, with me. 
 	 
 16with me, with firm holding yet haste, haste on. 
 	 
 for your life, adhere to me! 
 of all the men of the earth, i only can unloose you and toughen you; 
 i may have to be persuaded many times before i consent to give myself really to 
 	  you but what of that? 
 must not nature be persuaded many times? 
 	 
 no dainty dolce affettuoso i; 
 bearded, sun burnt, gray neck'd, forbidding, i have arrived, 
 to be wrestled with as i pass, for the solid prizes of the universe; 
 for such i afford whoever can persevere to win them. 
 	 
 17on my way a moment i pause; 
 here for you! and here for america! 
 still the present i raise aloft still the future of the states i harbinge, 
 	  glad and sublime; 
 and for the past, i pronounce what the air holds of the red aborigines. 
 	 
 the red aborigines! 
 leaving natural breaths, sounds of rain and winds, calls as of birds and animals 
 	  in the woods, syllabled to us for names; 
 okonee, koosa, ottawa, monongahela, sauk, natchez, chattahoochee, kaqueta, 
 	  oronoco, 
 wabash, miami, saginaw, chippewa, oshkosh, walla walla; 
 leaving such to the states, they melt, they depart, charging the water and the 
 	  land with names. 
 	 
 18o expanding and swift! o henceforth, 
 elements, breeds, adjustments, turbulent, quick, and audacious; 
 a world primal again vistas of glory, incessant and branching; 
 a new race, dominating previous ones, and grander far with new contests, 
 new politics, new literatures and religions, new inventions and arts. 
 	 
 these! my voice announcing i will sleep no more, but arise; 
 you oceans that have been calm within me! how i feel you, fathomless, stirring, 
 	  preparing unprecedented waves and storms. 
 	 
 19see! steamers steaming through my poems! 
 see, in my poems immigrants continually coming and landing; 
 see, in arriere, the wigwam, the trail, the hunter's hut, the flatboat, the 
 	  maize leaf, the claim, the rude fence, and the backwoods village; 
 see, on the one side the western sea, and on the other the eastern sea, how they 
 	  advance and retreat upon my poems, as upon their own shores. 
 	 
 see, pastures and forests in my poems see, animals, wild and tame see, 
 	  beyond the kanzas, countless herds of buffalo, feeding on short curly grass; 
 see, in my poems, cities, solid, vast, inland, with paved streets, with iron and 
 	  stone edifices, ceaseless vehicles, and commerce; 
 see, the many cylinder'd steam printing press see, the electric 
 	  telegraph, stretching across the continent, from the western sea to manhattan; 
 see, through atlantica's depths, pulses american, europe 
 	  reaching pulses of europe, duly return'd; 
 see, the strong and quick locomotive, as it departs, panting, blowing the 
 	  steam whistle; 
 see, ploughmen, ploughing farms see, miners, digging mines see, the 
 	  numberless factories; 
 see, mechanics, busy at their benches, with tools see from among them, 
 	  superior judges, philosophs, presidents, emerge, drest in working dresses; 
 see, lounging through the shops and fields of the states, me, well belov'd, 
 	  close held by day and night; 
 hear the loud echoes of my songs there! read the hints come at last. 
 	 
 20o camerado close! 
 o you and me at last and us two only. 
 	 
 o a word to clear one's path ahead endlessly! 
 o something extatic and undemonstrable! o music wild! 
 	 
 o now i triumph and you shall also; 
 o hand in hand o wholesome pleasure o one more desirer and lover! 
 o to haste, firm holding to haste, haste on with me. 
 an old man's thought of school; 
 an old man, gathering youthful memories and blooms, that youth itself cannot. 
 	 
 now only do i know you! 
 o fair auroral skies! o morning dew upon the grass! 
 	 
 and these i see these sparkling eyes, 
 these stores of mystic meaning these young lives, 
 building, equipping, like a fleet of ships immortal ships! 
 soon to sail out over the measureless seas, 
 on the soul's voyage. 
 	 
 only a lot of boys and girls? 
 only the tiresome spelling, writing, ciphering classes? 
 only a public school? 
 	 
 ah more infinitely more; 
 (as george fox rais'd his warning cry, “is it this pile of brick and 
 	  mortar these dead floors, windows, rails you call the church? 
 why this is not the church at all the church is living, ever living souls.”) 
 	 
 and you, america, 
 cast you the real reckoning for your present? 
 the lights and shadows of your future good or evil? 
 to girlhood, boyhood look the teacher and the school. 
 1 
 i sing the body electric; 
 the armies of those i love engirth me, and i engirth them; 
 they will not let me off till i go with them, respond to them, 
 and discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul. 
 	 
 was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves; 
 and if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead? 
 and if the body does not do as much as the soul? 
 and if the body were not the soul, what is the soul? 
 	 
 2 
 the love of the body of man or woman balks account the body itself balks account; 
 that of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect. 
 	 
 the expression of the face balks account; 
 but the expression of a well made man appears not only in his face; 
 it is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists; 
 	 
 it is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees dress does 
 	  not hide him; 
 the strong, sweet, supple quality he has, strikes through the cotton and flannel; 
 to see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more; 
 you linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder side. 
 	 
 the sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, 
 	  their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards, 
 the swimmer naked in the swimming bath, seen as he swims through the transparent 
 	  green shine, or lies with his face up, and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the 
 	  water, 
 the bending forward and backward of rowers in row boats the horseman in his saddle, 
 girls, mothers, house keepers, in all their performances, 
 the group of laborers seated at noon time with their open dinner kettles, and their wives 
 	  waiting, 
 the female soothing a child the farmer's daughter in the garden or cow yard, 
 the young fellow hoeing corn the sleigh driver guiding his six horses through the crowd, 
 	 
 the wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice boys, quite grown, lusty, good natured, 
 	  native born, out on the vacant lot at sundown, after work, 
 the coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance, 
 the upper hold and the under hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes; 
 the march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through 
 	  clean setting trowsers and waist straps, 
 the slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the 
 	  listening on the alert, 
 the natural, perfect, varied attitudes the bent head, the curv'd neck, and the 
 	  counting; 
 such like i love i loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother's breast with the 
 	  little child, 
 swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, 
 	  listen, and count. 
 	 
 3 
 i know a man, a common farmer the father of five sons; 
 and in them were the fathers of sons and in them were the fathers of sons. 
 	 
 this man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person; 
 the shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, and the 
 	  immeasurable meaning of his black eyes the richness and breadth of his manners, 
 these i used to go and visit him to see he was wise also; 
 he was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old his sons were massive, clean, 
 	  bearded, tan faced, handsome; 
 they and his daughters loved him all who saw him loved him; 
 they did not love him by allowance they loved him with personal love; 
 he drank water only the blood show'd like scarlet through the clear brown skin of his 
 	  face; 
 he was a frequent gunner and fisher he sail'd his boat himself he had a fine one 
 	  presented to him by a ship joiner he had fowling pieces, presented to him by men that 
 	  loved him; 
 when he went with his five sons and many grand sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him 
 	  out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang. 
 	 
 you would wish long and long to be with him you would wish to sit by him in the boat, 
 	  that you and he might touch each other. 
 	 
 4 
 i have perceiv'd that to be with those i like is enough, 
 to stop in company with the rest at evening is enough, 
 to be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough, 
 to pass among them, or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck 
 	  for a moment what is this, then? 
 i do not ask any more delight i swim in it, as in a sea. 
 	 
 there is something in staying close to men and women, and looking on them, and in the 
 	  contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well; 
 all things please the soul but these please the soul well. 
 	 
 5 
 this is the female form; 
 a divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot; 
 it attracts with fierce undeniable attraction! 
 i am drawn by its breath as if i were no more than a helpless vapor all falls aside but 
 	  myself and it; 
 books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, the atmosphere and the clouds, 
 	  and what was expected of heaven or fear'd of hell, are now consumed; 
 mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it the response likewise ungovernable; 
 hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands, all diffused mine too 
 	  diffused; 
 ebb stung by the flow, and flow stung by the ebb love flesh swelling and deliciously 
 	  aching; 
 limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white blow and 
 	  delirious juice; 
 bridegroom night of love, working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn; 
 undulating into the willing and yielding day, 
 lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet flesh'd day. 
 	 
 this is the nucleus after the child is born of woman, the man is born of woman; 
 this is the bath of birth this is the merge of small and large, and the outlet again. 
 	 
 be not ashamed, women your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest; 
 you are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul. 
 	 
 the female contains all qualities, and tempers them she is in her place, and moves with 
 	  perfect balance; 
 she is all things duly veil'd she is both passive and active; 
 she is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters. 
 	 
 as i see my soul reflected in nature; 
 as i see through a mist, one with inexpressible completeness and beauty, 
 see the bent head, and arms folded over the breast the female i see. 
 	 
 6 
 the male is not less the soul, nor more he too is in his place; 
 he too is all qualities he is action and power; 
 the flush of the known universe is in him; 
 scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well; 
 the wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost, become him 
 	  well pride is for him; 
 the full spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul; 
 knowledge becomes him he likes it always he brings everything to the test of himself; 
 whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail, he strikes soundings at last only 
 	  here; 
 (where else does he strike soundings, except here?) 
 	 
 the man's body is sacred, and the woman's body is sacred; 
 no matter who it is, it is sacred; 
 is it a slave? is it one of the dull faced immigrants just landed on the wharf? 
 each belongs here or anywhere, just as much as the well off just as much as you; 
 each has his or her place in the procession. 
 	 
 (all is a procession; 
 the universe is a procession, with measured and beautiful motion.) 
 	 
 do you know so much yourself, that you call the slave or the dull face ignorant? 
 do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight? 
 do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float and the soil is on the 
 	  surface, and water runs, and vegetation sprouts, 
 for you only, and not for him and her? 
 	 
 7 
 a man's body at auction; 
 i help the auctioneer the sloven does not half know his business. 
 	 
 gentlemen, look on this wonder! 
 whatever the bids of the bidders, they cannot be high enough for it; 
 for it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years, without one animal or plant; 
 for it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll'd. 
 	 
 in this head the all baffling brain; 
 in it and below it, the makings of heroes. 
 	 
 examine these limbs, red, black, or white they are so cunning in tendon and nerve; 
 they shall be stript, that you may see them. 
 	 
 exquisite senses, life lit eyes, pluck, volition, 
 flakes of breast muscle, pliant back bone and neck, flesh not flabby, good sized arms and 
 	  legs, 
 and wonders within there yet. 
 	 
 within there runs blood, 
 the same old blood! 
 the same red running blood! 
 there swells and jets a heart there all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations; 
 do you think they are not there because they are not express'd in parlors and 
 	  lecture rooms? 
 	 
 this is not only one man this is the father of those who shall be fathers in their 
 	  turns; 
 in him the start of populous states and rich republics; 
 of him countless immortal lives, with countless embodiments and enjoyments. 
 	 
 how do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries? 
 who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the 
 	  centuries? 
 	 
 8 
 a woman's body at auction! 
 she too is not only herself she is the teeming mother of mothers; 
 she is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers. 
 	 
 have you ever loved the body of a woman? 
 have you ever loved the body of a man? 
 your father where is your father? 
 your mother is she living? have you been much with her? and has she been much with you? 
 	 
 	 do you not see that these are exactly the same to all, in all nations and times, all 
 	  over the earth? 
 	 
 if any thing is sacred, the human body is sacred, 
 and the glory and sweet of a man, is the token of manhood untainted; 
 and in man or woman, a clean, strong, firm fibred body, is beautiful as the most beautiful 
 	  face. 
 	 
 have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her 
 	  own live body? 
 for they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves. 
 	 
 9 
 o my body! i dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women, nor the likes of the 
 	  parts of you; 
 i believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the soul, (and that they 
 	  are the soul;) 
 i believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems and that they are poems, 
 man's, woman's, child's, youth's, wife's, husband's, mother's, father's, 
 	  young man's, young woman's poems; 
 head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears, 
 eyes, eye fringes, iris of the eye, eye brows, and the waking or sleeping of the lids, 
 mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw hinges, 
 nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition, 
 cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck slue, 
 strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind shoulders, and the ample side round of the 
 	  chest. 
 	 
 upper arm, arm pit, elbow socket, lower arm, arm sinews, arm bones, 
 wrist and wrist joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, fore finger, finger balls, 
 	  finger joints, finger nails, 
 broad breast front, curling hair of the breast, breast bone, breast side, 
 ribs, belly, back bone, joints of the back bone, 
 hips, hip sockets, hip strength, inward and outward round, man balls, man root, 
 strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above, 
 leg fibres, knee, knee pan, upper leg, under leg, 
 ankles, instep, foot ball, toes, toe joints, the heel; 
 all attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your body, or of any 
 	  one's body, male or female, 
 the lung sponges, the stomach sac, the bowels sweet and clean, 
 the brain in its folds inside the skull frame, 
 sympathies, heart valves, palate valves, sexuality, maternity, 
 womanhood, and all that is a woman and the man that comes from woman, 
 the womb, the teats, nipples, breast milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love looks, 
 	  love perturbations and risings, 
 the voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud, 
 food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking, swimming, 
 poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, arm curving and tightening, 
 the continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes, 
 the skin, the sun burnt shade, freckles, hair, 
 the curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body, 
 the circling rivers, the breath, and breathing it in and out, 
 the beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees, 
 the thin red jellies within you, or within me the bones, and the marrow in the bones, 
 the exquisite realization of health; 
 o i say, these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but of the soul, 
 o i say now these are the soul! 
 i dream'd in a dream, i saw a city invincible to the attacks of the whole of the rest of 
 	  	  the 
 	  earth; 
 	 
 i dream'd that was the new city of friends; 
 nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love it led the rest; 
 it was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city, 
 and in all their looks and words. 	  	  	  	  5

 singing my days, 
 singing the great achievements of the present, 
 singing the strong, light works of engineers, 
 our modern wonders, (the antique ponderous seven outvied,) 
 in the old world, the east, the suez canal, 
 the new by its mighty railroad spann'd, 
 the seas inlaid with eloquent, gentle wires, 
 i sound, to commence, the cry, with thee, o soul, 
 the past! the past! the past! 
 	 
 the past! the dark, unfathom'd retrospect! 
 the teeming gulf! the sleepers and the shadows! 
 the past! the infinite greatness of the past! 
 for what is the present, after all, but a growth out of the past? 
 (as a projectile, form'd, impell'd, passing a certain line, still keeps on, 
 so the present, utterly form'd, impell'd by the past.) 
 	 
 2 
 passage, o soul, to india! 
 eclaircise the myths asiatic the primitive fables. 
 	 
 not you alone, proud truths of the world! 
 nor you alone, ye facts of modern science! 
 but myths and fables of eld asia's, africa's fables! 
 the far darting beams of the spirit! the unloos'd dreams! 
 the deep diving bibles and legends; 
 the daring plots of the poets the elder religions; 
 	 o you temples fairer than lilies, pour'd over by the rising sun! 
 o you fables, spurning the known, eluding the hold of the known, mounting to heaven! 
 you lofty and dazzling towers, pinnacled, red as roses, burnish'd with gold! 
 towers of fables immortal, fashion'd from mortal dreams! 
 you too i welcome, and fully, the same as the rest; 
 you too with joy i sing. 
 	 
 3 
 passage to india! 
 lo, soul! seest thou not god's purpose from the first? 
 the earth to be spann'd, connected by net work, 
 the people to become brothers and sisters, 
 the races, neighbors, to marry and be given in marriage, 
 the oceans to be cross'd, the distant brought near, 
 the lands to be welded together. 
 	 
 (a worship new, i sing; 
 you captains, voyagers, explorers, yours! 
 you engineers! you architects, machinists, your! 
 you, not for trade or transportation only, 
 but in god's name, and for thy sake, o soul.) 
 	 
 4 
 passage to india! 
 lo, soul, for thee, of tableaus twain, 
 i see, in one, the suez canal initiated, open'd, 
 i see the procession of steamships, the empress eugenie's leading the van; 
 i mark, from on deck, the strange landscape, the pure sky, the level sand in the distance; 
 	 
 i pass swiftly the picturesque groups, the workmen gather'd, 
 the gigantic dredging machines. 
 	 
 in one, again, different, (yet thine, all thine, o soul, the same,) 
 i see over my own continent the pacific railroad, surmounting every barrier; 
 i see continual trains of cars winding along the platte, carrying freight and passengers; 
 i hear the locomotives rushing and roaring, and the shrill steam whistle, 
 i hear the echoes reverberate through the grandest scenery in the world; 
 i cross the laramie plains i note the rocks in grotesque shapes the buttes; 
 i see the plentiful larkspur and wild onions the barren, colorless, sage deserts; 
 i see in glimpses afar, or towering immediately above me, the great mountains i see 
 	  	  the 
 	  wind river and the wahsatch mountains; 
 i see the monument mountain and the eagle's nest i pass the promontory i 
 	  	  ascend 
 	  the nevadas; 
 i scan the noble elk mountain, and wind around its base; 
 i see the humboldt range i thread the valley and cross the river, 
 i see the clear waters of lake tahoe i see forests of majestic pines, 
 or, crossing the great desert, the alkaline plains, i behold enchanting mirages of waters 
 	  	  and 
 	  meadows; 
 marking through these, and after all, in duplicate slender lines, 
 bridging the three or four thousand miles of land travel, 
 tying the eastern to the western sea, 
 the road between europe and asia. 
 	 
 (ah genoese, thy dream! thy dream! 
 centuries after thou art laid in thy grave, 
 the shore thou foundest verifies thy dream!) 
 	 
 5 
 passage to india! 
 struggles of many a captain tales of many a sailor dead! 
 over my mood, stealing and spreading they come, 
 like clouds and cloudlets in the unreach'd sky. 
 	 
 along all history, down the slopes, 
 as a rivulet running, sinking now, and now again to the surface rising, 
 a ceaseless thought, a varied train lo, soul! to thee, thy sight, they rise, 
 the plans, the voyages again, the expeditions: 
 again vasco de gama sails forth; 
 again the knowledge gain'd, the mariner's compass, 
 lands found, and nations born thou born, america, (a hemisphere unborn,) 
 for purpose vast, man's long probation fill'd, 
 thou, rondure of the world, at last accomplish'd. 
 	 
 6 
 o, vast rondure, swimming in space! 
 cover'd all over with visible power and beauty! 
 alternate light and day, and the teeming, spiritual darkness; 
 unspeakable, high processions of sun and moon, and countless stars, above; 
 below, the manifold grass and waters, animals, mountains, trees; 
 with inscrutable purpose some hidden, prophetic intention; 
 now, first, it seems, my thought begins to span thee. 
 	 
 down from the gardens of asia, descending, radiating, 
 adam and eve appear, then their myriad progeny after them, 
 wandering, yearning, curious with restless explorations, 
 with questionings, baffled, formless, feverish with never happy hearts, 
 with that sad, incessant refrain, wherefore, unsatisfied soul? and whither, o 
 	  	  mocking 
 	  life? 
 	 
 ah, who shall soothe these feverish children? 
 who justify these restless explorations? 
 who speak the secret of impassive earth? 
 who bind it to us? what is this separate nature, so unnatural? 
 what is this earth, to our affections? (unloving earth, without a throb to answer ours; 
 cold earth, the place of graves.) 
 	 
 yet, soul, be sure the first intent remains and shall be carried out; 
 (perhaps even now the time has arrived.) 
 	 
 after the seas are all cross'd, (as they seem already cross'd,) 
 after the great captains and engineers have accomplish'd their work, 
 after the noble inventors after the scientists, the chemist, the geologist, 
 	  	  ethnologist, 
 finally shall come the poet, worthy that name; 
 the true son of god shall come, singing his songs. 
 	 
 then, not your deeds only, o voyagers, o scientists and inventors, shall be justified, 
 all these hearts, as of fretted children, shall be sooth'd, 
 all affection shall be fully responded to the secret shall be told; 
 all these separations and gaps shall be taken up, and hook'd and link'd 
 	  	  together; 
 the whole earth this cold, impassive, voiceless earth, shall be completely justified; 
 	 
 trinitas divine shall be gloriously accomplish'd and compacted by the the son of god, 
 	  	  the 
 	  poet, 
 (he shall indeed pass the straits and conquer the mountains, 
 he shall double the cape of good hope to some purpose;) 
 nature and man shall be disjoin'd and diffused no more, 
 the true son of god shall absolutely fuse them. 
 	 
 7 
 year at whose open'd, wide flung door i sing! 
 year of the purpose accomplish'd! 
 year of the marriage of continents, climates and oceans! 
 (no mere doge of venice now, wedding the adriatic;) 
 i see, o year, in you, the vast terraqueous globe, given, and giving all, 
 europe to asia, africa join'd, and they to the new world; 
 the lands, geographies, dancing before you, holding a festival garland, 
 as brides and bridegrooms hand in hand. 
 	 
 8 
 passage to india! 
 cooling airs from caucasus far, soothing cradle of man, 
 the river euphrates flowing, the past lit up again. 
 	 
 lo, soul, the retrospect, brought forward; 
 the old, most populous, wealthiest of earth's lands, 
 the streams of the indus and the ganges, and their many affluents; 
 (i, my shores of america walking to day, behold, resuming all,) 
 the tale of alexander, on his warlike marches, suddenly dying, 
 on one side china, and on the other side persia and arabia, 
 to the south the great seas, and the bay of bengal; 
 the flowing literatures, tremendous epics, religions, castes, 
 old occult brahma, interminably far back the tender and junior buddha, 
 central and southern empires, and all their belongings, possessors, 
 the wars of tamerlane, the reign of aurungzebe, 
 the traders, rulers, explorers, moslems, venetians, byzantium, the arabs, portuguese, 
 the first travelers, famous yet, marco polo, batouta the moor, 
 doubts to be solv'd, the map incognita, blanks to be fill'd, 
 the foot of man unstay'd, the hands never at rest, 
 thyself, o soul, that will not brook a challenge. 
 	 
 9 
 the medieval navigators rise before me, 
 the world of 1492, with its awaken'd enterprise; 
 something swelling in humanity now like the sap of the earth in spring, 
 the sunset splendor of chivalry declining. 
 	 
 and who art thou, sad shade? 
 gigantic, visionary, thyself a visionary, 
 with majestic limbs, and pious, beaming eyes, 
 spreading around, with every look of thine, a golden world, 
 enhuing it with gorgeous hues. 
 	 
 as the chief histrion, 
 down to the footlights walks, in some great scena, 
 dominating the rest, i see the admiral himself, 
 (history's type of courage, action, faith;) 
 behold him sail from palos, leading his little fleet; 
 his voyage behold his return his great fame, 
 his misfortunes, calumniators behold him a prisoner, chain'd, 
 behold his dejection, poverty, death. 
 	 
 (curious, in time, i stand, noting the efforts of heroes; 
 is the deferment long? bitter the slander, poverty, death? 
 lies the seed unreck'd for centuries in the ground? lo! to god's due occasion, 
 uprising in the night, it sprouts, blooms, 
 and fills the earth with use and beauty.) 
 	 
 10 
 passage indeed, o soul, to primal thought! 
 not lands and seas alone thy own clear freshness, 
 the young maturity of brood and bloom; 
 to realms of budding bibles. 
 	 
 o soul, repressless, i with thee, and thou with me, 
 thy circumnavigation of the world begin; 
 of man, the voyage of his mind's return, 
 to reason's early paradise, 
 back, back to wisdom's birth, to innocent intuitions, 
 again with fair creation. 
 	 
 11 
 o we can wait no longer! 
 we too take ship, o soul! 
 joyous, we too launch out on trackless seas! 
 fearless, for unknown shores, on waves of extasy to sail, 
 amid the wafting winds, (thou pressing me to thee, i thee to me, o soul,) 
 caroling free singing our song of god, 
 chanting our chant of pleasant exploration. 
 	 
 with laugh, and many a kiss, 
 (let others deprecate let others weep for sin, remorse, humiliation;) 
 o soul, thou pleasest me i thee. 
 	 
 ah, more than any priest, o soul, we too believe in god; 
 but with the mystery of god we dare not dally. 
 	 
 o soul, thou pleasest me i thee; 
 sailing these seas, or on the hills, or waking in the night, 
 thoughts, silent thoughts, of time, and space, and death, like waters flowing, 
 bear me, indeed, as through the regions infinite, 
 whose air i breathe, whose ripples hear lave me all over; 
 bathe me, o god, in thee mounting to thee, 
 i and my soul to range in range of thee. 
 	 
 o thou transcendant! 
 nameless the fibre and the breath! 
 light of the light shedding forth universes thou centre of them! 
 thou mightier centre of the true, the good, the loving! 
 thou moral, spiritual fountain! affection's source! thou reservoir! 
 (o pensive soul of me! o thirst unsatisfied! waitest not there? 
 waitest not haply for us, somewhere there, the comrade perfect?) 
 thou pulse! thou motive of the stars, suns, systems, 
 that, circling, move in order, safe, harmonious, 
 athwart the shapeless vastnesses of space! 
 	 
 how should i think how breathe a single breath how speak if, out of myself, 
 i could not launch, to those, superior universes? 
 	 
 swiftly i shrivel at the thought of god, 
 at nature and its wonders, time and space and death, 
 but that i, turning, call to thee, o soul, thou actual me, 
 and lo! thou gently masterest the orbs, 
 thou matest time, smilest content at death, 
 and fillest, swellest full, the vastnesses of space. 
 	 
 greater than stars or suns, 
 bounding, o soul, thou journeyest forth; 
 	 what love, than thine and ours could wider amplify? 
 what aspirations, wishes, outvie thine and ours, o soul? 
 what dreams of the ideal? what plans of purity, perfection, strength? 
 what cheerful willingness, for others' sake, to give up all? 
 for others' sake to suffer all? 
 	 
 reckoning ahead, o soul, when thou, the time achiev'd, 
 (the seas all cross'd, weather'd the capes, the voyage done,) 
 surrounded, copest, frontest god, yieldest, the aim attain'd, 
 as, fill'd with friendship, love complete, the elder brother found, 
 the younger melts in fondness in his arms. 
 	 
 12 
 passage to more than india! 
 are thy wings plumed indeed for such far flights? 
 o soul, voyagest thou indeed on voyages like these? 
 disportest thou on waters such as these? 
 soundest below the sanscrit and the vedas? 
 then have thy bent unleash'd. 
 	 
 passage to you, your shores, ye aged fierce enigmas! 
 passage to you, to mastership of you, ye strangling problems! 
 you, strew'd with the wrecks of skeletons, that, living, never reach'd you. 
 	 
 13 
 passage to more than india! 
 o secret of the earth and sky! 
 of you, o waters of the sea! o winding creeks and rivers! 
 of you, o woods and fields! of you, strong mountains of my land! 
 of you, o prairies! of you, gray rocks! 
 o morning red! o clouds! o rain and snows! 
 o day and night, passage to you! 
 	 
 o sun and moon, and all you stars! sirius and jupiter! 
 passage to you! 
 	 
 passage immediate passage! the blood burns in my veins! 
 away, o soul! hoist instantly the anchor! 
 cut the hawsers haul out shake out every sail! 
 have we not stood here like trees in the ground long enough? 
 have we not grovell'd here long enough, eating and drinking like mere brutes? 
 have we not darken'd and dazed ourselves with books long enough? 
 	 
 sail forth! steer for the deep waters only! 
 reckless, o soul, exploring, i with thee, and thou with me; 
 for we are bound where mariner has not yet dared to go, 
 and we will risk the ship, ourselves and all. 
 	 
 o my brave soul! 
 o farther, farther sail! 
 o daring joy, but safe! are they not all the seas of god? 
 o farther, farther, farther sail! 
 1 
 in former songs pride have i sung, and love, and passionate, joyful life, 
 but here i twine the strands of patriotism and death. 
 	 
 and now, life, pride, love, patriotism and death, 
 to you, o freedom, purport of all! 
 (you that elude me most refusing to be caught in songs of mine,) 
 i offer all to you. 
 	 
 2 
 'tis not for nothing, death, 
 i sound out you, and words of you, with daring tone embodying you, 
 in my new democratic chants keeping you for a close, 
 for last impregnable retreat a citadel and tower, 
 for my last stand my pealing, final cry. 
 1 
 o star of france! 
 the brightness of thy hope and strength and fame, 
 like some proud ship that led the fleet so long, 
 beseems to day a wreck, driven by the gale a mastless hulk; 
 and 'mid its teeming, madden'd, half drown'd crowds, 
 nor helm nor helmsman. 
 	 
 2 
 dim, smitten star! 
 orb not of france alone pale symbol of my soul, its dearest hopes, 
 the struggle and the daring rage divine for liberty, 
 of aspirations toward the far ideal enthusiast's dreams of brotherhood, 
 of terror to the tyrant and the priest. 
 	 
 3 
 star crucified! by traitors sold! 
 star panting o'er a land of death heroic land! 
 strange, passionate, mocking, frivolous land. 
 	 
 miserable! yet for thy errors, vanities, sins, i will not now rebuke thee; 
 thy unexampled woes and pangs have quell'd them all, 
 and left thee sacred. 
 	 
 in that amid thy many faults, thou ever aimedest highly, 
 in that thou wouldst not really sell thyself, however great the price, 
 in that thou surely wakedst weeping from thy drugg'd sleep, 
 in that alone, among thy sisters, thou, giantess, didst rend the ones that shamed thee, 
 in that thou couldst not, wouldst not, wear the usual chains, 
 this cross, thy livid face, thy pierced hands and feet, 
 the spear thrust in thy side. 
 	 
 4 
 o star! o ship of france, beat back and baffled long! 
 bear up, o smitten orb! o ship, continue on! 
 	 
 sure, as the ship of all, the earth itself, 
 product of deathly fire and turbulent chaos, 
 forth from its spasms of fury and its poisons, 
 issuing at last in perfect power and beauty, 
 onward, beneath the sun, following its course, 
 so thee, o ship of france! 
 	 
 finish'd the days, the clouds dispell'd, 
 the travail o'er, the long sought extrication, 
 when lo! reborn, high o'er the european world, 
 (in gladness, answering thence, as face afar to face, reflecting ours, columbia,) 
 again thy star, o france fair, lustrous star, 
 in heavenly peace, clearer, more bright than ever, 
 shall beam immortal. 
 why! who makes much of a miracle? 
 as to me, i know of nothing else but miracles, 
 whether i walk the streets of manhattan, 
 or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky, 
 or wade with naked feet along the beach, just in the edge of the water, 
 or stand under trees in the woods, 
 or talk by day with any one i love or sleep in the bed at night with any one i love, 
 or sit at table at dinner with my mother, 
 or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car, 
 or watch honey bees busy around the hive, of a summer forenoon, 
 or animals feeding in the fields, 
 or birds or the wonderfulness of insects in the air, 
 or the wonderfulness of the sun down or of stars shining so quiet and bright, 
 or the exquisite, delicate, thin curve of the new moon in spring; 
 or whether i go among those i like best, and that like me best mechanics, boatmen, 
 	  farmers, 
 or among the savans or to the soiree or to the opera, 
 or stand a long while looking at the movements of machinery, 
 or behold children at their sports, 
 or the admirable sight of the perfect old man, or the perfect old woman, 
 or the sick in hospitals, or the dead carried to burial, 
 or my own eyes and figure in the glass; 
 these, with the rest, one and all, are to me miracles, 
 the whole referring yet each distinct, and in its place. 
 	 
 to me, every hour of the light and dark is a miracle, 
 every cubic inch of space is a miracle, 
 every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same, 
 every foot of the interior swarms with the same; 
 every spear of grass the frames, limbs, organs, of men and women, and all that 
 	  	  concerns 
 	  them, 
 all these to me are unspeakably perfect miracles. 
 	 
 to me the sea is a continual miracle; 
 the fishes that swim the rocks the motion of the waves the ships, with men 
 	  	  in 
 	  them, 
 what stranger miracles are there? 
 1 
 i say whatever tastes sweet to the most perfect person, that is finally right. 
 2 
 i say nourish a great intellect, a great brain; 
 if i have said anything to the contrary, i hereby retract it. 
 	 
 3 
 i say man shall not hold property in man; 
 i say the least developed person on earth is just as important and sacred to himself or 
 	  herself, as the most developed person is to himself or herself. 
 	 
 4 
 i say where liberty draws not the blood out of slavery, there slavery draws the blood out 
 	  	  of 
 	  liberty, 
 i say the word of the good old cause in these states, and resound it hence over the world. 
 	 
 	 
 5 
 i say the human shape or face is so great, it must never be made ridiculous; 
 i say for ornaments nothing outre can be allowed, 
 and that anything is most beautiful without ornament, 
 and that exaggerations will be sternly revenged in your own physiology, and in other 
 	  persons' physiology also; 
 and i say that clean shaped children can be jetted and conceived only where natural forms 
 	  prevail in public, and the human face and form are never caricatured; 
 and i say that genius need never more be turned to romances, 
 (for facts properly told, how mean appear all romances.) 
 	 
 6 
 i say the word of lands fearing nothing i will have no other land; 
 i say discuss all and expose all i am for every topic openly; 
 i say there can be no salvation for these states without innovators without free 
 	  	  tongues, 
 	  and ears willing to hear the tongues; 
 and i announce as a glory of these states, that they respectfully listen to propositions, 
 	  reforms, fresh views and doctrines, from successions of men and women, 
 each age with its own growth. 
 	 
 7 
 i have said many times that materials and the soul are great, and that all depends on 
 	  	  physique; 
 now i reverse what i said, and affirm that all depends on the æsthetic or 
 	  	  intellectual, 
 and that criticism is great and that refinement is greatest of all; 
 and i affirm now that the mind governs and that all depends on the mind. 
 	 
 8 
 with one man or woman (no matter which one i even pick out the lowest,) 
 with him or her i now illustrate the whole law; 
 i say that every right, in politics or what not, shall be eligible to that one man or 
 	  	  woman, on 
 	  the same terms as any. 
 out of the murk of heaviest clouds, 
 out of the feudal wrecks, and heap'd up skeletons of kings, 
 out of that old entire european debris the shatter'd mummeries, 
 ruin'd cathedrals, crumble of palaces, tombs of priests, 
 lo! freedom's features, fresh, undimm'd, look forth the same immortal face 
 	  	  looks 
 	  forth; 
 (a glimpse as of thy mother's face, columbia, 
 a flash significant as of a sword, 
 beaming towards thee.) 
 	 
 nor think we forget thee, maternal; 
 lag'd'st thou so long? shall the clouds close again upon thee? 
 ah, but thou hast thyself now appear'd to us we know thee; 
 thou hast given us a sure proof, the glimpse of thyself; 
 thou waitest there, as everywhere, thy time. 
 on journeys through the states we start, 
 (ay, through the world urged by these songs, 
 sailing henceforth to every land to every sea;) 
 we, willing learners of all, teachers of all, and lovers of all. 
 	 
 we have watch'd the seasons dispensing themselves, and passing on, 
 we have said, why should not a man or woman do as much as the seasons, and effuse as much? 
 	 
 	 
 we dwell a while in every city and town; 
 we pass through kanada, the north east, the vast valley of the mississippi, and the 
 	  	  southern 
 	  states; 
 we confer on equal terms with each of the states, 
 we make trial of ourselves, and invite men and women to hear; 
 we say to ourselves, remember, fear not, be candid, promulge the body and the soul; 
 dwell a while and pass on be copious, temperate, chaste, magnetic, 
 and what you effuse may then return as the seasons return, 
 and may be just as much as the seasons. 
 1 
 proud music of the storm! 
 blast that careers so free, whistling across the prairies! 
 strong hum of forest tree tops! wind of the mountains! 
 personified dim shapes! you hidden orchestras! 
 you serenades of phantoms, with instruments alert, 
 blending, with nature's rhythmus, all the tongues of nations; 
 you chords left us by vast composers! you choruses! 
 you formless, free, religious dances! you from the orient! 
 you undertone of rivers, roar of pouring cataracts; 
 you sounds from distant guns, with galloping cavalry! 
 echoes of camps, with all the different bugle calls! 
 trooping tumultuous, filling the midnight late, bending me powerless, 
 entering my lonesome slumber chamber why have you seiz'd me? 
 	 
 2 
 come forward, o my soul, and let the rest retire; 
 listen lose not it is toward thee they tend; 
 parting the midnight, entering my slumber chamber, 
 for thee they sing and dance, o soul. 
 	 
 a festival song! 
 the duet of the bridegroom and the bride a marriage march, 
 with lips of love, and hearts of lovers, fill'd to the brim with love; 
 the red flush'd cheeks, and perfumes the cortege swarming, full of friendly 
 	  	  faces, 
 	  young and old, 
 to flutes' clear notes, and sounding harps' cantabile. 
 	 
 3 
 now loud approaching drums! 
 victoria! see'st thou in powder smoke the banners torn but flying? the rout of the 
 	  baffled? 
 hearest those shouts of a conquering army? 
 	 
 (ah, soul, the sobs of women the wounded groaning in agony, 
 the hiss and crackle of flames the blacken'd ruins the embers of cities, 
 the dirge and desolation of mankind.) 
 	 
 4 
 now airs antique and medieval fill me! 
 i see and hear old harpers with their harps, at welsh festivals: 
 i hear the minnesingers, singing their lays of love, 
 i hear the minstrels, gleemen, troubadours, of the feudal ages. 
 	 
 5 
 now the great organ sounds, 
 tremulous while underneath, (as the hid footholds of the earth, 
 on which arising, rest, and leaping forth, depend, 
 all shapes of beauty, grace and strength all hues we know, 
 green blades of grass, and warbling birds children that gambol and play the 
 	  	  clouds of 
 	  heaven above,) 
 the strong base stands, and its pulsations intermits not, 
 bathing, supporting, merging all the rest maternity of all the rest; 
 and with it every instrument in multitudes, 
 the players playing all the world's musicians, 
 the solemn hymns and masses, rousing adoration, 
 all passionate heart chants, sorrowful appeals, 
 the measureless sweet vocalists of ages, 
 and for their solvent setting, earth's own diapason, 
 of winds and woods and mighty ocean waves; 
 a new composite orchestra binder of years and climes ten fold renewer, 
 as of the far back days the poets tell the paradiso, 
 the straying thence, the separation long, but now the wandering done, 
 the journey done, the journeyman come home, 
 and man and art, with nature fused again. 
 	 
 6 
 tutti! for earth and heaven! 
 the almighty leader now for me, for once has signal'd with his wand. 
 	 
 the manly strophe of the husbands of the world, 
 and all the wives responding. 
 	 
 the tongues of violins! 
 (i think, o tongues, ye tell this heart, that cannot tell itself; 
 this brooding, yearning heart, that cannot tell itself.) 
 	 
 7 
 ah, from a little child, 
 thou knowest, soul, how to me all sounds became music; 
 my mother's voice, in lullaby or hymn; 
 (the voice o tender voices memory's loving voices! 
 last miracle of all o dearest mother's, sister's, voices;) 
 the rain, the growing corn, the breeze among the long leav'd corn, 
 the measur'd sea surf, beating on the sand, 
 the twittering bird, the hawk's sharp scream, 
 the wild fowl's notes at night, as flying low, migrating north or south, 
 the psalm in the country church, or mid the clustering trees, the open air camp meeting, 
 the fiddler in the tavern the glee, the long strung sailor song, 
 the lowing cattle, bleating sheep the crowing cock at dawn. 
 	 
 8 
 all songs of current lands come sounding 'round me, 
 the german airs of friendship, wine and love, 
 irish ballads, merry jigs and dances english warbles, 
 chansons of france, scotch tunes and o'er the rest, 
 italia's peerless compositions. 
 	 
 across the stage, with pallor on her face, yet lurid passion, 
 stalks norma, brandishing the dagger in her hand. 
 	 
 i see poor crazed lucia's eyes' unnatural gleam; 
 her hair down her back falls loose and dishevell'd. 
 	 
 i see where ernani, walking the bridal garden, 
 amid the scent of night roses, radiant, holding his bride by the hand, 
 hears the infernal call, the death pledge of the horn. 
 	 
 to crossing swords, and grey hairs bared to heaven, 
 the clear, electric base and baritone of the world, 
 the trombone duo libertad forever! 
 	 
 from spanish chestnut trees' dense shade, 
 by old and heavy convent walls, a wailing song, 
 song of lost love the torch of youth and life quench'd in despair, 
 song of the dying swan fernando's heart is breaking. 
 	 
 awaking from her woes at last, retriev'd amina sings; 
 copious as stars, and glad as morning light, the torrents of her joy. 
 	 
 (the teeming lady comes! 
 the lustrious orb venus contralto the blooming mother, 
 sister of loftiest gods alboni's self i hear.) 
 	 
 9 
 i hear those odes, symphonies, operas; 
 i hear in the william tell, the music of an arous'd and angry people; 
 i hear meyerbeer's huguenots, the prophet, or robert; 
 gounod's faust, or mozart's don juan. 
 	 
 10 
 i hear the dance music of all nations, 
 the waltz, (some delicious measure, lapsing, bathing me in bliss;) 
 the bolero, to tinkling guitars and clattering castanets. 
 	 
 i see religious dances old and new, 
 i hear the sound of the hebrew lyre, 
 i see the crusaders marching, bearing the cross on high, to the martial clang of cymbals; 
 i hear dervishes monotonously chanting, interspers'd with frantic shouts, as they 
 	  	  spin 
 	  around, turning always towards mecca; 
 i see the rapt religious dances of the persians and the arabs; 
 again, at eleusis, home of ceres, i see the modern greeks dancing, 
 i hear them clapping their hands, as they bend their bodies, 
 i hear the metrical shuffling of their feet. 
 	 
 i see again the wild old corybantian dance, the performers wounding each other; 
 i see the roman youth, to the shrill sound of flageolets, throwing and catching their 
 	  	  weapons, 
 as they fall on their knees, and rise again. 
 	 
 i hear from the mussulman mosque the muezzin calling; 
 i see the worshippers within, (nor form, nor sermon, argument, nor word, 
 but silent, strange, devout rais'd, glowing heads extatic faces.) 
 	 
 11 
 i hear the egyptian harp of many strings, 
 the primitive chants of the nile boatmen; 
 the sacred imperial hymns of china, 
 to the delicate sounds of the king, (the stricken wood and stone;) 
 or to hindu flutes, and the fretting twang of the vina, 
 a band of bayaderes. 
 	 
 12 
 now asia, africa leave me europe, seizing, inflates me; 
 to organs huge, and bands, i hear as from vast concourses of voices, 
 luther's strong hymn, eine feste burg ist unser gott; 
 rossini's stabat mater dolorosa; 
 or, floating in some high cathedral dim, with gorgeous color'd windows, 
 the passionate agnus dei, or gloria in excelsis. 
 	 
 13 
 composers! mighty maestros! 
 and you, sweet singers of old lands soprani! tenori! bassi! 
 to you a new bard, carolling free in the west, 
 obeisant, sends his love. 
 	 
 (such led to thee, o soul! 
 all senses, shows and objects, lead to thee, 
 but now, it seems to me, sound leads o'er all the rest.) 
 	 
 14 
 i hear the annual singing of the children in st. paul's cathedral; 
 or, under the high roof of some colossal hall, the symphonies, oratorios of beethoven, 
 	  	  handel, 
 	  or haydn; 
 the creation, in billows of godhood laves me. 
 	 
 give me to hold all sounds, (i, madly struggling, cry,) 
 fill me with all the voices of the universe, 
 endow me with their throbbings nature's also, 
 the tempests, waters, winds operas and chants marches and dances, 
 utter pour in for i would take them all. 
 	 
 15 
 then i woke softly, 
 and pausing, questioning awhile the music of my dream, 
 and questioning all those reminiscences the tempest in its fury, 
 and all the songs of sopranos and tenors, 
 and those rapt oriental dances, of religious fervor, 
 and the sweet varied instruments, and the diapason of organs, 
 and all the artless plaints of love, and grief and death, 
 i said to my silent, curious soul, out of the bed of the slumber chamber, 
 come, for i have found the clue i sought so long, 
 let us go forth refresh'd amid the day, 
 cheerfully tallying life, walking the world, the real, 
 nourish'd henceforth by our celestial dream. 
 	 
 and i said, moreover, 
 haply, what thou hast heard, o soul, was not the sound of winds, 
 nor dream of raging storm, nor sea hawk's flapping wings, nor harsh scream, 
 nor vocalism of sun bright italy, 
 nor german organ majestic nor vast concourse of voices nor layers of harmonies; 
 nor strophes of husbands and wives nor sound of marching soldiers, 
 nor flutes, nor harps, nor the bugle calls of camps; 
 but, to a new rhythmus fitted for thee, 
 poems, bridging the way from life to death, vaguely wafted in night air, uncaught, 
 	  	  unwritten, 
 which, let us go forth in the bold day, and write. 
 1 
 out of the rolling ocean, the crowd, came a drop gently to me, 
 whispering, i love you, before long i die, 
 i have travel'd a long way, merely to look on you, to touch you, 
 for i could not die till i once look'd on you, 
 for i fear'd i might afterward lose you. 
 	 
 2 
 (now we have met, we have look'd, we are safe; 
 return in peace to the ocean, my love; 
 i too am part of that ocean, my love we are not so much separated; 
 behold the great rondure the cohesion of all, how perfect! 
 but as for me, for you, the irresistible sea is to separate us, 
 as for an hour, carrying us diverse yet cannot carry us diverse for ever; 
 be not impatient a little space know you, i salute the air, the ocean and the 
 	  land, 
 every day, at sundown, for your dear sake, my love.) 
 1 
 as the time draws nigh, glooming, a cloud, 
 a dread beyond, of i know not what, darkens me. 
 	 
 i shall go forth, 
 i shall traverse the states awhile but i cannot tell whither or how long; 
 perhaps soon, some day or night while i am singing, my voice will suddenly cease. 
 	 
 2 
 o book, o chants! must all then amount to but this? 
 must we barely arrive at this beginning of us?... and yet it is enough, o soul! 
 o soul! we have positively appear'd that is enough. 
 native moments! when you come upon me ah you are here now! 
 give me now libidinous joys only! 
 give me the drench of my passions! give me life coarse and rank! 
 to day, i go consort with nature's darlings to night too; 
 i am for those who believe in loose delights i share the midnight orgies of young men; 
 i dance with the dancers, and drink with the drinkers; 
 the echoes ring with our indecent calls; 
 i take for my love some prostitute i pick out some low person for my dearest friend, 
 he shall be lawless, rude, illiterate he shall be one condemn'd by others for deeds 
 	  done; 
 i will play a part no longer why should i exile myself from my companions? 
 o you shunn'd persons! i at least do not shun you, 
 i come forthwith in your midst i will be your poet, 
 i will be more to you than to any of the rest. 
 what general has a good army in himself, has a good army; 
 he happy in himself, or she happy in herself, is happy, 
 but i tell you you cannot be happy by others, any more than you can beget or conceive a 
 	  	  child 
 	  by others. 
 spontaneous me, nature, 
 the loving day, the mounting sun, the friend i am happy with, 
 the arm of my friend hanging idly over my shoulder, 
 the hill side whiten'd with blossoms of the mountain ash, 
 the same, late in autumn the hues of red, yellow, drab, purple, and light and dark 
 	  green, 
 the rich coverlid of the grass animals and birds the private untrimm'd 
 	  bank the primitive apples the pebble stones, 
 beautiful dripping fragments the negligent list of one after another, as i happen to 
 	  call them to me, or think of them, 
 the real poems, (what we call poems being merely pictures,) 
 the poems of the privacy of the night, and of men like me, 
 this poem, drooping shy and unseen, that i always carry, and that all men carry, 
 (know, once for all, avow'd on purpose, wherever are men like me, are our lusty, 
 	  lurking, masculine poems;) 
 love thoughts, love juice, love odor, love yielding, love climbers, and the climbing sap, 
 arms and hands of love lips of love phallic thumb of love breasts of 
 	  love bellies press'd and glued together with love, 
 earth of chaste love life that is only life after love, 
 the body of my love the body of the woman i love the body of the man the 
 	  body of the earth, 
 soft forenoon airs that blow from the south west, 
 the hairy wild bee that murmurs and hankers up and down that gripes the full grown 
 	  lady flower, curves upon her with amorous firm legs, takes his will of her, and holds 
 	  himself tremulous and tight till he is satisfied, 
 the wet of woods through the early hours, 
 two sleepers at night lying close together as they sleep, one with an arm slanting down 
 	  across and below the waist of the other, 
 the smell of apples, aromas from crush'd sage plant, mint, birch bark, 
 the boy's longings, the glow and pressure as he confides to me what he was dreaming, 
 the dead leaf whirling its spiral whirl, and falling still and content to the ground, 
 the no form'd stings that sights, people, objects, sting me with, 
 the hubb'd sting of myself, stinging me as much as it ever can any one, 
 the sensitive, orbic, underlapp'd brothers, that only privileged feelers may be 
 	  intimate where they are, 
 the curious roamer, the hand, roaming all over the body the bashful withdrawing of 
 	  flesh where the fingers soothingly pause and edge themselves, 
 the limpid liquid within the young man, 
 the vexed corrosion, so pensive and so painful, 
 the torment the irritable tide that will not be at rest, 
 the like of the same i feel the like of the same in others, 
 the young man that flushes and flushes, and the young woman that flushes and flushes, 
 the young man that wakes, deep at night, the hot hand seeking to repress what would master 
 	  him; 
 the mystic amorous night the strange half welcome pangs, visions, sweats, 
 the pulse pounding through palms and trembling encircling fingers the young man all 
 	  color'd, red, ashamed, angry; 
 the souse upon me of my lover the sea, as i lie willing and naked, 
 the merriment of the twin babes that crawl over the grass in the sun, the mother never 
 	  turning her vigilant eyes from them, 
 the walnut trunk, the walnut husks, and the ripening or ripen'd long round walnuts; 
 the continence of vegetables, birds, animals, 
 the consequent meanness of me should i skulk or find myself indecent, while birds and 
 	  animals never once skulk or find themselves indecent; 
 the great chastity of paternity, to match the great chastity of maternity, 
 the oath of procreation i have sworn my adamic and fresh daughters, 
 the greed that eats me day and night with hungry gnaw, till i saturate what shall produce 
 	  boys to fill my place when i am through, 
 the wholesome relief, repose, content; 
 and this bunch, pluck'd at random from myself; 
 it has done its work i tossed it carelessly to fall where it may. 
 o sun of real peace! o hastening light! 
 o free and extatic! o what i here, preparing, warble for! 
 o the sun of the world will ascend, dazzling, and take his height and you too, o my 
 	  	  ideal, 
 	  will surely ascend! 
 o so amazing and broad up there resplendent, darting and burning! 
 o vision prophetic, stagger'd with weight of light! with pouring glories! 
 o lips of my soul, already becoming powerless! 
 o ample and grand presidentiads! now the war, the war is over! 
 new history! new heroes! i project you! 
 visions of poets! only you really last! sweep on! sweep on! 
 o heights too swift and dizzy yet! 
 o purged and luminous! you threaten me more than i can stand! 
 (i must not venture the ground under my feet menaces me it will not support me: 
 o future too immense,) o present, i return, while yet i may, to you. 
 lo! the unbounded sea! 
 on its breast a ship starting, spreading all her sails an ample ship, 
 	  carrying even her moonsails; 
 the pennant is flying aloft, as she speeds, she speeds so stately below, 
 	  emulous waves press forward, 
 they surround the ship, with shining curving motions, and foam. 
 adieu, o soldier! 
 you of the rude campaigning, (which we shared,) 
 the rapid march, the life of the camp, 
 the hot contention of opposing fronts the long manoeuver, 
 red battles with their slaughter, the stimulus the strong, terrific game, 
 spell of all brave and manly hearts the trains of time through you, and like of you, 
 	  	  all 
 	  fill'd, 
 with war, and war's expression. 
 	 
 adieu, dear comrade! 
 your mission is fulfill'd but i, more warlike, 
 myself, and this contentious soul of mine, 
 still on our own campaigning bound, 
 through untried roads, with ambushes, opponents lined, 
 through many a sharp defeat and many a crisis often baffled, 
 here marching, ever marching on, a war fight out aye here, 
 to fiercer, weightier battles give expression. 
 1 
 i wander all night in my vision, 
 stepping with light feet, swiftly and noiselessly stepping and stopping, 
 bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers, 
 wandering and confused, lost to myself, ill assorted, contradictory, 
 pausing, gazing, bending, and stopping. 
 	 
 how solemn they look there, stretch'd and still! 
 how quiet they breathe, the little children in their cradles! 
 	 
 the wretched features of ennuyés, the white features of corpses, the livid faces of 
 	  drunkards, the sick gray faces of onanists, 
 the gash'd bodies on battle fields, the insane in their strong door'd rooms, the 
 	  sacred 
 	  idiots, the new born emerging from gates, and the dying emerging from gates, 
 the night pervades them and infolds them. 
 	 
 the married couple sleep calmly in their bed he with his palm on the hip of the wife, 
 	  	  and 
 	  she 
 	  with her palm on the hip of the husband, 
 the sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed, 
 the men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs, 
 and the mother sleeps, with her little child carefully wrapt. 
 	 
 the blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep, 
 the prisoner sleeps well in the prison the run away son sleeps; 
 the murderer that is to be hung next day how does he sleep? 
 and the murder'd person how does he sleep? 
 	 
 the female that loves unrequited sleeps, 
 and the male that loves unrequited sleeps, 
 the head of the money maker that plotted all day sleeps, 
 and the enraged and treacherous dispositions all, all sleep. 
 	 
 2 
 i stand in the dark with drooping eyes by the worst suffering and the most restless, 
 i pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them, 
 the restless sink in their beds they fitfully sleep. 
 	 
 now i pierce the darkness new beings appear, 
 the earth recedes from me into the night, 
 i saw that it was beautiful, and i see that what is not the earth is beautiful. 
 	 
 i go from bedside to bedside i sleep close with the other sleepers, each in turn, 
 i dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers, 
 and i become the other dreamers. 
 	 
 3 
 i am a dance play up, there! the fit is whirling me fast! 
 	 
 i am the ever laughing it is new moon and twilight, 
 i see the hiding of douceurs i see nimble ghosts whichever way i look, 
 cache, and cache again, deep in the ground and sea, and where it is neither ground or sea. 
 	 
 well do they do their jobs, those journeymen divine, 
 only from me can they hide nothing, and would not if they could, 
 i reckon i am their boss, and they make me a pet besides, 
 and surround me and lead me, and run ahead when i walk, 
 to lift their cunning covers, to signify me with stretch'd arms, and resume the way; 
 onward we move! a gay gang of blackguards! with mirth shouting music, and wild flapping 
 	  pennants of 
 	  joy! 
 	 
 4 
 i am the actor, the actress, the voter, the politician; 
 the emigrant and the exile, the criminal that stood in the box, 
 he who has been famous, and he who shall be famous after to day, 
 the stammerer, the well form'd person, the wasted or feeble person. 
 	 
 5 
 i am she who adorn'd herself and folded her hair expectantly, 
 my truant lover has come, and it is dark. 
 	 
 double yourself and receive me, darkness! 
 receive me and my lover too he will not let me go without him. 
 	 
 i roll myself upon you, as upon a bed i resign myself to the dusk. 
 	 
 6 
 he whom i call answers me, and takes the place of my lover, 
 he rises with me silently from the bed. 
 	 
 darkness! you are gentler than my lover his flesh was sweaty and panting, 
 i feel the hot moisture yet that he left me. 
 	 
 my hands are spread forth, i pass them in all directions, 
 i would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying. 
 	 
 be careful, darkness! already, what was it touch'd me? 
 i thought my lover had gone, else darkness and he are one, 
 i hear the heart beat i follow, i fade away. 
 	 
 7 
 o hot cheek'd and blushing! o foolish hectic! 
 o for pity's sake, no one must see me now! my clothes were stolen while i was abed, 
 now i am thrust forth, where shall i run? 
 	 
 pier that i saw dimly last night, when i look'd from the windows! 
 pier out from the main, let me catch myself with you, and stay i will not chafe you, 
 i feel ashamed to go naked about the world. 
 	 
 i am curious to know where my feet stand and what this is flooding me, childhood or 
 	  manhood and the hunger that crosses the bridge between. 
 	 
 8 
 the cloth laps a first sweet eating and drinking, 
 laps life swelling yolks laps ear of rose corn, milky and just ripen'd; 
 the white teeth stay, and the boss tooth advances in darkness, 
 and liquor is spill'd on lips and bosoms by touching glasses, and the best liquor 
 	  afterward. 
 	 
 9 
 i descend my western course, my sinews are flaccid, 
 perfume and youth course through me, and i am their wake. 
 	 
 it is my face yellow and wrinkled, instead of the old woman's, 
 i sit low in a straw bottom chair, and carefully darn my grandson's stockings. 
 	 
 it is i too, the sleepless widow, looking out on the winter midnight, 
 i see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth. 
 	 
 a shroud i see, and i am the shroud i wrap a body, and lie in the coffin, 
 it is dark here under ground it is not evil or pain here it is blank here, for 
 	  reasons. 
 	 
 it seems to me that everything in the light and air ought to be happy, 
 whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave, let him know he has enough. 
 	 
 10 
 i see a beautiful gigantic swimmer, swimming naked through the eddies of the sea, 
 his brown hair lies close and even to his head he strikes out with courageous 
 	  	  arms he 
 	  urges himself with his legs, 
 i see his white body i see his undaunted eyes, 
 i hate the swift running eddies that would dash him head foremost on the rocks. 
 	 
 what are you doing, you ruffianly red trickled waves? 
 will you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the prime of his middle age? 
 	 
 steady and long he struggles, 
 he is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd he holds out while his strength holds out, 
 the slapping eddies are spotted with his blood they bear him away they roll him, 
 	  swing 
 	  him, turn him, 
 his beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is continually bruis'd on 
 	  	  rocks, 
 swiftly and out of sight is borne the brave corpse. 
 	 
 11 
 i turn, but do not extricate myself, 
 confused, a past reading, another, but with darkness yet. 
 	 
 the beach is cut by the razory ice wind the wreck guns sound, 
 the tempest lulls the moon comes floundering through the drifts. 
 	 
 i look where the ship helplessly heads end on i hear the burst as she strikes i 
 	  	  hear 
 	  the 
 	  howls of dismay they grow fainter and fainter. 
 	 
 i cannot aid with my wringing fingers, 
 i can but rush to the surf, and let it drench me and freeze upon me. 
 	 
 i search with the crowd not one of the company is wash'd to us alive; 
 in the morning i help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a barn. 
 	 
 12 
 now of the older war days, the defeat at brooklyn, 
 washington stands inside the lines he stands on the intrench'd hills, amid a 
 	  	  crowd of 
 	  officers, 
 his face is cold and damp he cannot repress the weeping drops, 
 he lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes the color is blanch'd from his 
 	  	  cheeks, 
 he sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by their parents. 
 	 
 the same, at last and at last, when peace is declared, 
 he stands in the room of the old tavern the well belov'd soldiers all pass 
 	  	  through, 
 the officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns, 
 the chief encircles their necks with his arm, and kisses them on the cheek, 
 he kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another he shakes hands, and bids good by 
 	  	  to 
 	  the 
 	  army. 
 	 
 13 
 now i tell what my mother told me to day as we sat at dinner together, 
 of when she was a nearly grown girl, living home with her parents on the old homestead. 
 	 
 a red squaw came one breakfast time to the old homestead, 
 on her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush bottoming chairs, 
 her hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half envelop'd her face, 
 her step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely as she spoke. 
 	 
 my mother look'd in delight and amazement at the stranger, 
 she look'd at the freshness of her tall borne face, and full and pliant limbs, 
 the more she look'd upon her, she loved her, 
 never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity, 
 she made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace she cook'd food for 
 	  	  her, 
 she had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and fondness. 
 	 
 the red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of the afternoon she went 
 	  	  away, 
 o my mother was loth to have her go away! 
 all the week she thought of her she watch'd for her many a month, 
 she remember'd her many a winter and many a summer, 
 but the red squaw never came, nor was heard of there again. 
 	 
 14 
 now lucifer was not dead or if he was, i am his sorrowful terrible heir; 
 i have been wrong'd i am oppress'd i hate him that oppresses me, 
 i will either destroy him, or he shall release me. 
 	 
 damn him! how he does defile me! 
 how he informs against my brother and sister, and takes pay for their blood! 
 how he laughs when i look down the bend, after the steamboat that carries away my woman! 
 	 
 now the vast dusk bulk that is the whale's bulk, it seems mine; 
 warily, sportsman! though i lie so sleepy and sluggish, the tap of my flukes is death. 
 	 
 15 
 a show of the summer softness! a contact of something unseen! an amour of the light and 
 	  	  air! 
 i am jealous, and overwhelm'd with friendliness, 
 and will go gallivant with the light and air myself, 
 and have an unseen something to be in contact with them also. 
 	 
 o love and summer! you are in the dreams, and in me! 
 autumn and winter are in the dreams the farmer goes with his thrift, 
 the droves and crops increase, and the barns are well fill'd. 
 	 
 16 
 elements merge in the night ships make tacks in the dreams, 
 the sailor sails the exile returns home, 
 the fugitive returns unharm'd the immigrant is back beyond months and years, 
 the poor irishman lives in the simple house of his childhood, with the well known 
 	  	  neighbors and 
 	  faces, 
 they warmly welcome him he is barefoot again, he forgets he is well off; 
 the dutchman voyages home, and the scotchman and welshman voyage home, and the native of 
 	  	  the 
 	  mediterranean voyages home, 
 to every port of england, france, spain, enter well fill'd ships, 
 the swiss foots it toward his hills the prussian goes his way, the hungarian his way, 
 	  	  and 
 	  the 
 	  pole his way, 
 the swede returns, and the dane and norwegian return. 
 	 
 17 
 the homeward bound, and the outward bound, 
 the beautiful lost swimmer, the ennuyé, the onanist, the female that loves 
 	  	  unrequited, 
 	  the 
 	  money maker, 
 the actor and actress, those through with their parts, and those waiting to commence, 
 the affectionate boy, the husband and wife, the voter, the nominee that is chosen, and the 
 	  nominee 
 	  that has fail'd, 
 the great already known, and the great any time after to day, 
 the stammerer, the sick, the perfect form'd, the homely, 
 the criminal that stood in the box, the judge that sat and sentenced him, the fluent 
 	  	  lawyers, 
 	  the 
 	  jury, the audience, 
 the laugher and weeper, the dancer, the midnight widow, the red squaw, 
 the consumptive, the erysipelite, the idiot, he that is wrong'd, 
 the antipodes, and every one between this and them in the dark, 
 i swear they are averaged now one is no better than the other, 
 the night and sleep have liken'd them and restored them. 
 	 
 i swear they are all beautiful; 
 every one that sleeps is beautiful everything in the dim light is beautiful, 
 the wildest and bloodiest is over, and all is peace. 
 	 
 18 
 peace is always beautiful, 
 the myth of heaven indicates peace and night. 
 	 
 the myth of heaven indicates the soul; 
 the soul is always beautiful it appears more or it appears less it comes, or it 
 	  	  lags 
 	  behind, 
 it comes from its embower'd garden, and looks pleasantly on itself, and encloses the 
 	  world, 
 perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting, and perfect and clean the womb 
 	  	  cohering, 
 the head well grown, proportion'd and plumb, and the bowels and joints 
 	  	  proportion'd 
 	  and 
 	  plumb. 
 	 
 19 
 the soul is always beautiful, 
 the universe is duly in order, everything is in its place, 
 what has arrived is in its place, and what waits is in its place; 
 the twisted skull waits, the watery or rotten blood waits, 
 the child of the glutton or venerealee waits long, and the child of the drunkard waits 
 	  	  long, 
 	  and the 
 	  drunkard himself waits long, 
 the sleepers that lived and died wait the far advanced are to go on in their turns, 
 	  	  and 
 	  the far 
 	  behind are to come on in their turns, 
 the diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall flow and unite they unite now. 
 	 
 20 
 the sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed, 
 they flow hand in hand over the whole earth, from east to west, as they lie unclothed, 
 the asiatic and african are hand in hand the european and american are hand in hand, 
 learn'd and unlearn'd are hand in hand, and male and female are hand in hand, 
 the bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her lover they press close 
 	  	  without 
 	  lust his lips press her neck, 
 the father holds his grown or ungrown son in his arms with measureless love, and the son 
 	  	  holds 
 	  the 
 	  father in his arms with measureless love, 
 the white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist of the daughter, 
 the breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man, friend is inarm'd by friend, 
 the scholar kisses the teacher, and the teacher kisses the scholar the wrong'd 
 	  	  is 
 	  made 
 	  right, 
 the call of the slave is one with the master's call, and the master salutes the 
 	  	  slave, 
 the felon steps forth from the prison the insane becomes sane the suffering of 
 	  	  sick 
 	  persons is reliev'd, 
 the sweatings and fevers stop the throat that was unsound is sound the lungs of 
 	  	  the

 i too pass from the night, 
 i stay a while away, o night, but i return to you again, and love you. 
 	 
 why should i be afraid to trust myself to you? 
 i am not afraid i have been well brought forward by you; 
 i love the rich running day, but i do not desert her in whom i lay so long, 
 i know not how i came of you, and i know not where i go with you but i know i came 
 	  	  well, 
 	  and 
 	  shall go well. 
 	 
 i will stop only a time with the night, and rise betimes; 
 i will duly pass the day, o my mother, and duly return to you. 
 this moment yearning and thoughtful, sitting alone, 
 it seems to me there are other men in other lands, yearning and thoughtful; 
 it seems to me i can look over and behold them, in germany, italy, france, spain or far, 
 	  	  far 
 	  away, 
 	  in china, or in russia or india talking other dialects; 
 and it seems to me if i could know those men, i should become attached to them, as i do to 
 	  	  men 
 	  in my 
 	  own lands; 
 o i know we should be brethren and lovers, 
 i know i should be happy with them. 
 women sit, or move to and fro some old, some young; 
 the young are beautiful but the old are more beautiful than the young. 
 send but a song oversea for us, 
 heart of their hearts who are free, 
 heart of their singer, to be for us 
 more than our singing can be; 
 ours, in the tempest at error, 
 with no light but the twilight of terror; 
 send us a song oversea! 
 	 
 sweet smelling of pine leaves and grasses, 
 and blown as a tree through and through 
 with the winds of the keen mountain passes, 
 and tender as sun smitten dew; 
 sharp tongued as the winter that shakes 
 the wastes of your limitless lakes, 
 wide eyed as the sea line's blue. 
 	 
 o strong winged soul with prophetic 
 lips hot with the bloodheats of song, 
 with tremor of heartstrings magnetic, 
 with thoughts as thunders in throng, 
 with consonant ardours of chords 
 that pierce men's souls as with swords 
 and hale them hearing along, 
 	 
 make us too music, to be with us 
 as a word from a world's heart warm, 
 to sail the dark as a sea with us, 
 full sailed, outsinging the storm, 
 a song to put fire in our ears 
 whose burning shall burn up tears, 
 whose sign bid battle reform; 
 	 
 a note in the ranks of a clarion, 
 a word in the wind of cheer, 
 to consume as with lightning the carrion 
 that makes time foul for us here; 
 in the air that our dead things infest 
 a blast of the breath of the west, 
 till east way as west way is clear. 
 	 
 out of the sun beyond sunset, 
 from the evening whence morning shall be, 
 with the rollers in measureless onset, 
 with the van of the storming sea, 
 with the world wide wind, with the breath 
 that breaks ships driven upon death, 
 with the passion of all things free, 
 	 
 with the sea steeds footless and frantic, 
 white myriads for death to bestride 
 in the charge of the ruining atlantic 
 where deaths by regiments ride, 
 with clouds and clamours of waters, 
 with a long note shriller than slaughter's 
 on the furrowless fields world wide, 
 	 
 with terror, with ardour and wonder, 
 with the soul of the season that wakes 
 when the weight of a whole year's thunder 
 in the tidestream of autumn breaks, 
 let the flight of the wide winged word 
 come over, come in and be heard, 
 take form and fire for our sakes. 
 	 
 for a continent bloodless with travail 
 here toils and brawls as it can, 
 and the web of it who shall unravel 
 of all that peer on the plan; 
 would fain grow men, but they grow not, 
 and fain be free, but they know not 
 one name for freedom and man? 
 	 
 one name, not twain for division; 
 one thing, not twain, from the birth; 
 spirit and substance and vision, 
 worth more than worship is worth; 
 unbeheld, unadored, undivined, 
 the cause, the centre, the mind, 
 the secret and sense of the earth. 
 	 
 here as a weakling in irons, 
 here as a weanling in bands, 
 as a prey that the stake net environs, 
 our life that we looked for stands; 
 and the man child naked and dear, 
 democracy, turns on us here 
 eyes trembling with tremulous hands 
 	 
 it sees not what season shall bring to it 
 sweet fruit of its bitter desire; 
 few voices it hears yet sing to it, 
 few pulses of hearts reaspire; 
 foresees not time, nor forehears 
 the noises of imminent years, 
 earthquake, and thunder, and fire: 
 	 
 when crowned and weaponed and curbless 
 it shall walk without helm or shield 
 the bare burnt furrows and herbless 
 of war's last flame stricken field, 
 till godlike, equal with time, 
 it stand in the sun sublime, 
 in the godhead of man revealed. 
 	 
 round your people and over them 
 light like raiment is drawn, 
 close as a garment to cover them 
 wrought not of mail nor of lawn; 
 here, with hope hardly to wear, 
 naked nations and bare 
 swim, sink, strike out for the dawn. 
 	 
 chains are here, and a prison, 
 kings, and subjects, and shame; 
 if the god upon you be arisen, 
 how should our songs be the same? 
 how, in confusion of change, 
 how shall we sing, in a strange 
 land, songs praising his name? 
 	 
 god is buried and dead to us, 
 even the spirit of earth, 
 freedom; so have they said to us, 
 some with mocking and mirth, 
 some with heartbreak and tears; 
 and a god without eyes, without ears, 
 who shall sing of him, dead in the birth? 
 	 
 the earth god freedom, the lonely 
 face lightening, the footprint unshod, 
 not as one man crucified only 
 nor scourged with but one life's rod; 
 the soul that is substance of nations, 
 reincarnate with fresh generations; 
 the great god man, which is god. 
 	 
 but in weariest of years and obscurest 
 doth it live not at heart of all things, 
 the one god and one spirit, a purest 
 life, fed from unstanchable springs? 
 within love, within hatred it is, 
 and its seed in the stripe as the kiss, 
 and in slaves is the germ, and in kings. 
 	 
 freedom we call it, for holier 
 name of the soul's there is none; 
 surelier it labours if slowlier, 
 than the metres of star or of sun; 
 slowlier than life into breath, 
 surelier than time into death, 
 it moves till its labour be done. 
 	 
 till the motion be done and the measure 
 circling through season and clime, 
 slumber and sorrow and pleasure, 
 vision of virtue and crime; 
 till consummate with conquering eyes, 
 a soul disembodied, it rise 
 from the body transfigured of time. 
 	 
 till it rise and remain and take station 
 with the stars of the worlds that rejoice; 
 till the voice of its heart's exultation 
 be as theirs an invariable voice; 
 by no discord of evil estranged, 
 by no pause, by no breach in it changed, 
 by no clash in the chord of its choice. 
 	 
 it is one with the world's generations, 
 with the spirit, the star, and the sod; 
 with the kingless and king stricken nations, 
 with the cross, and the chain, and the rod; 
 the most high, the most secret, most lonely, 
 the earth soul freedom, that only 
 lives, and that only is god. 
 there was a child went forth every day; 
 and the first object he look'd upon, that object he became; 
 and that object became part of him for the day, or a certain part of the day, or for many 
 	  years, or 
 	  stretching cycles of years. 
 	 
 the early lilacs became part of this child, 
 and grass, and white and red morning glories, and white and red clover, and the song of 
 	  	  the 
 	  phoebe bird, 
 and the third month lambs, and the sow's pink faint litter, and the mare's foal, 
 	  	  and 
 	  the 
 	  cow's calf, 
 and the noisy brood of the barn yard, or by the mire of the pond side, 
 and the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there and the beautiful curious 
 	  liquid, 
 and the water plants with their graceful flat heads all became part of him. 
 	 
 the field sprouts of fourth month and fifth month became part of him; 
 winter grain sprouts, and those of the light yellow corn, and the esculent roots of the 
 	  	  garden, 
 	 
 and the apple trees cover'd with blossoms, and the fruit afterward, and wood berries, 
 	  	  and 
 	  the 
 	  commonest weeds by the road; 
 and the old drunkard staggering home from the out house of the tavern, whence he had 
 	  	  lately 
 	  risen, 
 and the school mistress that pass'd on her way to the school, 
 and the friendly boys that pass'd and the quarrelsome boys, 
 and the tidy and fresh cheek'd girls and the barefoot negro boy and girl, 
 and all the changes of city and country, wherever he went. 
 	 
 his own parents, 
 he that had father'd him, and she that had conceiv'd him in her womb, and 
 	  birth'd 
 	  him, 
 they gave this child more of themselves than that; 
 they gave him afterward every day they became part of him. 
 	 
 the mother at home, quietly placing the dishes on the supper table; 
 the mother with mild words clean her cap and gown, a wholesome odor falling off her 
 	  	  person 
 	  and 
 	  clothes as she walks by; 
 the father, strong, self sufficient, manly, mean, anger'd, unjust; 
 the blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the crafty lure, 
 the family usages, the language, the company, the furniture the yearning and swelling 
 	  heart, 
 affection that will not be gainsay'd the sense of what is real the thought 
 	  	  if, 
 	  after 
 	  all, it should prove unreal, 
 the doubts of day time and the doubts of night time the curious whether and how, 
 whether that which appears so is so, or is it all flashes and specks? 
 men and women crowding fast in the streets if they are not flashes and specks, what 
 	  	  are 
 	  they? 
 the streets themselves, and the façades of houses, and goods in the windows, 
 vehicles, teams, the heavy plank'd wharves the huge crossing at the ferries, 
 the village on the highland, seen from afar at sunset the river between, 
 shadows, aureola and mist, the light falling on roofs and gables of white or brown, three 
 	  	  miles 
 	  off, 
 	 
 the schooner near by, sleepily dropping down the tide the little boat 
 	  	  slack tow'd 
 	  astern, 
 the hurrying tumbling waves, quick broken crests, slapping, 
 the strata of color'd clouds, the long bar of maroon tint, away solitary by 
 	  itself the 
 	  spread of purity it lies motionless in, 
 the horizon's edge, the flying sea crow, the fragrance of salt marsh and shore mud; 
 these became part of that child who went forth every day, and who now goes, and will 
 	  	  always go 
 	  forth 
 	  every day. 
 1 
 to think of time of all that retrospection! 
 to think of to day, and the ages continued henceforward! 
 	 
 have you guess'd you yourself would not continue? 
 have you dreaded these earth beetles? 
 have you fear'd the future would be nothing to you? 
 	 
 is to day nothing? is the beginningless past nothing? 
 if the future is nothing, they are just as surely nothing. 
 	 
 to think that the sun rose in the east! that men and women were flexible, real, alive! 
 	  	  that 
 	  everything was alive! 
 to think that you and i did not see, feel, think, nor bear our part! 
 to think that we are now here, and bear our part! 
 	 
 2 
 not a day passes not a minute or second, without an accouchement! 
 not a day passes not a minute or second, without a corpse! 
 	 
 the dull nights go over, and the dull days also, 
 the soreness of lying so much in bed goes over, 
 the physician, after long putting off, gives the silent and terrible look for an answer, 
 the children come hurried and weeping, and the brothers and sisters are sent for, 
 medicines stand unused on the shelf (the camphor smell has long pervaded the rooms,) 
 the faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the dying, 
 the twitching lips press lightly on the forehead of the dying, 
 the breath ceases, and the pulse of the heart ceases, 
 the corpse stretches on the bed, and the living look upon it, 
 it is palpable as the living are palpable. 
 	 
 the living look upon the corpse with their eye sight, 
 but without eye sight lingers a different living, and looks curiously on the corpse. 
 	 
 3 
 to think the thought of death, merged in the thought of materials! 
 to think that the rivers will flow, and the snow fall, and fruits ripen, and act upon 
 	  	  others as 
 	  upon us now yet not act upon us! 
 to think of all these wonders of city and country, and others taking great interest in 
 	  them and we taking no interest in them! 
 	 
 to think how eager we are in building our houses! 
 to think others shall be just as eager, and we quite indifferent! 
 	 
 (i see one building the house that serves him a few years, or seventy or eighty years at 
 	  	  most, 
 i see one building the house that serves him longer than that.) 
 	 
 slow moving and black lines creep over the whole earth they never cease they are 
 	  	  the 
 	  burial lines, 
 he that was president was buried, and he that is now president shall surely be buried. 
 	 
 4 
 a reminiscence of the vulgar fate, 
 a frequent sample of the life and death of workmen, 
 each after his kind: 
 cold dash of waves at the ferry wharf posh and ice in the river, half frozen mud in 
 	  	  the 
 	  streets, a gray, discouraged sky overhead, the short, last daylight of twelfth month, 
 a hearse and stages other vehicles give place the funeral of an old broadway 
 	  stage driver, the cortege mostly drivers. 
 	 
 steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death bell, the gate is pass'd, the 
 	  new dug grave is halted at, the living alight, the hearse uncloses, 
 the coffin is pass'd out, lower'd and settled, the whip is laid on the coffin, 
 	  	  the 
 	  earth is swiftly shovel'd in, 
 the mound above is flatted with the spades silence, 
 a minute no one moves or speaks it is done, 
 he is decently put away is there anything more? 
 	 
 he was a good fellow, free mouth'd, quick temper'd, not bad looking, able to 
 	  	  take his 
 	  own part, witty, sensitive to a slight, ready with life or death for a friend, fond of 
 	  	  women, 
 	  gambled, ate hearty, drank hearty, had known what it was to be flush, grew low spirited 
 	  	  toward 
 	  the last, sicken'd, was help'd by a contribution, died, aged forty one 
 	  	  years and 
 	  that was his funeral. 
 	 
 thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape, gloves, strap, wet weather clothes, whip 
 	  carefully chosen, boss, spotter, starter, hostler, somebody loafing on you, you loafing 
 	  	  on 
 	  somebody, headway, man before and man behind, good day's work, bad day's work, 
 	  	  pet 
 	  stock, mean stock, first out, last out, turning in at night; 
 to think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers and he there takes no 
 	  interest in them! 
 	 
 5 
 the markets, the government, the working man's wages to think what account they 
 	  	  are 
 	  through our nights and days! 
 to think that other working men will make just as great account of them yet we make 
 	  	  little 
 	  or no account! 
 	 
 the vulgar and the refined what you call sin, and what you call goodness to 
 	  	  think how 
 	  wide a difference! 
 to think the difference will still continue to others, yet we lie beyond the difference. 
 	 
 to think how much pleasure there is! 
 have you pleasure from looking at the sky? have you pleasure from poems? 
 do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in business? or planning a nomination and 
 	  election? or with your wife and family? 
 or with your mother and sisters? or in womanly housework? or the beautiful maternal cares? 
 	 
 	 these also flow onward to others you and i flow onward, 
 but in due time, you and i shall take less interest in them. 
 	 
 your farm, profits, crops, to think how engross'd you are! 
 to think there will still be farms, profits, crops yet for you, of what avail? 
 	 
 6 
 what will be, will be well for what is, is well, 
 to take interest is well, and not to take interest shall be well. 
 	 
 the sky continues beautiful, 
 the pleasure of men with women shall never be sated, nor the pleasure of women with men, 
 	  	  nor 
 	  the pleasure from poems, 
 the domestic joys, the daily housework or business, the building of houses these are 
 	  	  not 
 	  phantasms they have weight, form, location; 
 farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government, are none of them phantasms, 
 the difference between sin and goodness is no delusion, 
 the earth is not an echo man and his life, and all the things of his life, are 
 	  well consider'd. 
 	 
 you are not thrown to the winds you gather certainly and safely around yourself; 
 yourself! yourself! yourself, forever and ever! 
 	 
 7 
 it is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and father it is to 
 	  	  identify 
 	  you; 
 it is not that you should be undecided, but that you should be decided; 
 something long preparing and formless is arrived and form'd in you, 
 you are henceforth secure, whatever comes or goes. 
 	 
 the threads that were spun are gather'd, the weft crosses the warp, the pattern is 
 	  systematic. 
 	 
 the preparations have every one been justified, 
 the orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments the baton has given the 
 	  	  signal. 
 	 
 the guest that was coming he waited long, for reasons he is now housed, 
 he is one of those who are beautiful and happy he is one of those that to look upon 
 	  	  and be 
 	  with is enough. 
 	 
 the law of the past cannot be eluded, 
 the law of the present and future cannot be eluded, 
 the law of the living cannot be eluded it is eternal, 
 the law of promotion and transformation cannot be eluded, 
 the law of heroes and good doers cannot be eluded, 
 the law of drunkards, informers, mean persons not one iota thereof can be eluded. 
 	 
 8 
 slow moving and black lines go ceaselessly over the earth, 
 northerner goes carried, and southerner goes carried, and they on the atlantic side, and 
 	  	  they 
 	  on the pacific, and they between, and all through the mississippi country, and all over 
 	  	  the 
 	  earth. 
 	 
 the great masters and kosmos are well as they go the heroes and good doers are well, 
 the known leaders and inventors, and the rich owners and pious and distinguish'd, may 
 	  	  be 
 	  well, 
 but there is more account than that there is strict account of all. 
 	 
 the interminable hordes of the ignorant and wicked are not nothing, 
 the barbarians of africa and asia are not nothing, 
 the common people of europe are not nothing the american aborigines are not nothing, 
 the infected in the immigrant hospital are not nothing the murderer or mean person is 
 	  	  not 
 	  nothing, 
 the perpetual successions of shallow people are not nothing as they go, 
 the lowest prostitute is not nothing the mocker of religion is not nothing as he 
 	  	  goes. 
 	 
 9 
 of and in all these things, 
 i have dream'd that we are not to be changed so much, nor the law of us changed, 
 i have dream'd that heroes and good doers shall be under the present and past law, 
 and that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be under the present and past law, 
 for i have dream'd that the law they are under now is enough. 
 	 
 if otherwise, all came but to ashes of dung, 
 if maggots and rats ended us, then alarum! for we are betray'd! 
 then indeed suspicion of death. 
 	 
 do you suspect death? if i were to suspect death, i should die now, 
 do you think i could walk pleasantly and well suited toward annihilation? 
 	 
 10 
 pleasantly and well suited i walk, 
 whither i walk i cannot define, but i know it is good, 
 the whole universe indicates that it is good, 
 the past and the present indicate that it is good. 
 	 
 how beautiful and perfect are the animals! 
 how perfect the earth, and the minutest thing upon it! 
 	 
 what is called good is perfect, and what is called bad is just as perfect, 
 the vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and the imponderable fluids are perfect; 
 slowly and surely they have pass'd on to this, and slowly and surely they yet pass 
 	  	  on. 
 	 
 11 
 i swear i think now that everything without exception has an eternal soul! 
 the trees have, rooted in the ground! the weeds of the sea have! the animals! 
 	 
 i swear i think there is nothing but immortality! 
 that the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebulous float is for it, and the cohering is 
 	  	  for 
 	  it; 
 and all preparation is for it! and identity is for it! and life and materials are 
 	  	  altogether 
 	  for it 
 on the beach at night alone, 
 as the old mother sways her to and fro, singing her husky song, 
 as i watch the bright stars shining i think a thought of the clef of the universes, and of 
 	  the future. 
 	 
 a vast similitude interlocks all, 
 all spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns, moons, planets, comets, asteroids, 
 all the substances of the same, and all that is spiritual upon the same, 
 all distances of place, however wide, 
 all distances of time all inanimate forms, 
 all souls all living bodies, though they be ever so different, or in different worlds, 
 all gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes the fishes, the brutes, 
 all men and women me also; 
 all nations, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, languages; 
 all identities that have existed, or may exist, on this globe, or any globe; 
 all lives and deaths all of the past, present, future; 
 this vast similitude spans them, and always has spann'd, and shall forever span them, and 
 	  compactly hold them, and enclose them. 
 that music always round me, unceasing, unbeginning yet long untaught i did not hear; 
 but now the chorus i hear, and am elated; 
 a tenor, strong, ascending, with power and health, with glad notes of day break i hear, 
 a soprano, at intervals, sailing buoyantly over the tops of immense waves, 
 a transparent bass, shuddering lusciously under and through the universe, 
 the triumphant tutti the funeral wailings, with sweet flutes and violins all 
 	  	  these i 
 	  fill myself with; 
 i hear not the volumes of sound merely i am moved by the exquisite meanings, 
 i listen to the different voices winding in and out, striving, contending with fiery 
 	  	  vehemence 
 	  to excel each other in emotion; 
 i do not think the performers know themselves but now i think i begin to know them. 
 these, i, singing in spring, collect for lovers, 
 (for who but i should understand lovers, and all their sorrow and joy? 
 and who but i should be the poet of comrades?) 
 collecting, i traverse the garden, the world but soon i pass the gates, 
 now along the pond side now wading in a little, fearing not the wet, 
 now by the post and rail fences, where the old stones thrown there, pick'd from the 
 	  fields, 
 	  have accumulated, 
 (wild flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones, and partly cover 
 	  	  them beyond 
 	  these i pass,) 
 far, far in the forest, before i think where i go, 
 solitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in the silence, 
 alone i had thought yet soon a troop gathers around me, 
 some walk by my side, and some behind, and some embrace my arms or neck, 
 they, the spirits of dear friends, dead or alive thicker they come, a great crowd, 
 	  	  and i 
 	  in the 
 	  middle, 
 collecting, dispensing, singing in spring, there i wander with them, 
 plucking something for tokens tossing toward whoever is near me; 
 here! lilac, with a branch of pine, 
 here, out of my pocket, some moss which i pull'd off a live oak in florida, as it 
 	  	  hung 
 	  trailing 
 	  down, 
 here, some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage, 
 and here what i now draw from the water, wading in the pondside, 
 (o here i last saw him that tenderly loves me and returns again, never to separate 
 	  	  from 
 	  me, 
 and this, o this shall henceforth be the token of comrades this calamus root shall, 
 interchange it, youths, with each other! let none render it back!) 
 and twigs of maple, and a bunch of wild orange, and chestnut, 
 and stems of currants, and plum blows, and the aromatic cedar: 
 these, i, compass'd around by a thick cloud of spirits, 
 wandering, point to, or touch as i pass, or throw them loosely from me, 
 indicating to each one what he shall have giving something to each; 
 but what i drew from the water by the pond side, that i reserve, 
 i will give of it but only to them that love, as i myself am capable of loving. 
 weave in! weave in, my hardy life! 
 weave yet a soldier strong and full, for great campaigns to come; 
 weave in red blood! weave sinews in, like ropes! the senses, sight weave in! 
 weave lasting sure! weave day and night the weft, the warp, incessant weave! tire not! 
 (we know not what the use, o life! nor know the aim, the end nor really aught we 
 	  	  know; 
 but know the work, the need goes on, and shall go on the death envelop'd march 
 	  	  of 
 	  peace as well as war goes on;) 
 for great campaigns of peace the same, the wiry threads to weave; 
 we know not why or what, yet weave, forever weave. 
 the indications, and tally of time; 
 perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs; 
 time, always without flaw, indicates itself in parts; 
 what always indicates the poet, is the crowd of the pleasant company of singers, and their 
 	  words; 
 the words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or dark but the words 
 	  	  of 
 	  the

 to day a rude brief recitative, 
 of ships sailing the seas, each with its special flag or ship signal; 
 of unnamed heroes in the ships of waves spreading and spreading, far as the eye can reach; 
 	 
 of dashing spray, and the winds piping and blowing; 
 and out of these a chant, for the sailors of all nations, 
 fitful, like a surge. 
 	 
 of sea captains young or old, and the mates and of all intrepid sailors; 
 of the few, very choice, taciturn, whom fate can never surprise, nor death dismay, 
 pick'd sparingly, without noise, by thee, old ocean chosen by thee, 
 thou sea, that pickest and cullest the race, in time, and unitest nations! 
 suckled by thee, old husky nurse embodying thee! 
 indomitable, untamed as thee. 
 	 
 (ever the heroes, on water or on land, by ones or twos appearing, 
 ever the stock preserv'd, and never lost, though rare enough for seed preserv'd.) 
 	 
 2 
 flaunt out o sea, your separate flags of nations! 
 flaunt out, visible as ever, the various ship signals! 
 but do you reserve especially for yourself, and for the soul of man, one flag above all 
 	  	  the 
 	  rest, 
 a spiritual woven signal, for all nations, emblem of man elate above death, 
 token of all brave captains, and all intrepid sailors and mates, 
 and all that went down doing their duty; 
 reminiscent of them twined from all intrepid captains, young or old; 
 a pennant universal, subtly waving, all time, o'er all brave sailors, 
 all seas, all ships. 
 1 
 come, said the muse, 
 sing me a song no poet yet has chanted, 
 sing me the universal. 
 	 
 in this broad earth of ours, 
 amid the measureless grossness and the slag, 
 enclosed and safe within its central heart, 
 nestles the seed perfection. 
 	 
 by every life a share, or more or less, 
 none born but it is born conceal'd or unconceal'd, the seed is waiting. 
 	 
 2 
 lo! keen eyed, towering science! 
 as from tall peaks the modern overlooking, 
 successive, absolute fiats issuing. 
 	 
 yet again, lo! the soul above all science; 
 for it, has history gather'd like a husk around the globe; 
 for it, the entire star myriads roll through the sky. 
 	 
 in spiral roads, by long detours, 
 (as a much tacking ship upon the sea,) 
 for it, the partial to the permanent flowing, 
 for it, the real to the ideal tends. 
 	 
 for it, the mystic evolution; 
 not the right only justified what we call evil also justified. 
 	 
 forth from their masks, no matter what, 
 from the huge, festering trunk from craft and guile and tears, 
 health to emerge, and joy joy universal. 
 	 
 out of the bulk, the morbid and the shallow, 
 out of the bad majority the varied, countless frauds of men and states, 
 	 
 electric, antiseptic yet cleaving, suffusing all, 
 only the good is universal. 
 	 
 3 
 over the mountain growths, disease and sorrow, 
 an uncaught bird is ever hovering, hovering, 
 high in the purer, happier air. 
 	 
 from imperfection's murkiest cloud, 
 darts always forth one ray of perfect light, 
 one flash of heaven's glory. 
 	 
 to fashion's, custom's discord, 
 to the mad babel din, the deafening orgies, 
 soothing each lull, a strain is heard, just heard, 
 from some far shore, the final chorus sounding. 
 	 
 4 
 o the blest eyes! the happy hearts! 
 that see that know the guiding thread so fine, 
 along the mighty labyrinth! 
 	 
 5 
 and thou, america! 
 for the scheme's culmination its thought, and its reality, 
 for these, (not for thyself,) thou hast arrived. 
 	 
 thou too surroundest all; 
 embracing, carrying, welcoming all, thou too, by pathways broad and new, 
 to the ideal tendest. 
 	 
 the measur'd faiths of other lands the grandeurs of the past, 
 are not for thee but grandeurs of thine own; 
 deific faiths and amplitudes, absorbing, comprehending all, 
 all eligible to all. 
 	 
 all, all for immortality! 
 love, like the light, silently wrapping all! 
 nature's amelioration blessing all! 
 the blossoms, fruits of ages orchards divine and certain; 
 forms, objects, growths, humanities, to spiritual images ripening. 
 	 
 6 
 give me, o god, to sing that thought! 
 give me give him or her i love, this quenchless faith 
 in thy ensemble. whatever else withheld, withhold not from us, 
 belief in plan of thee enclosed in time and space; 
 health, peace, salvation universal. 
 	 
 is it a dream? 
 nay, but the lack of it the dream, 
 and, failing it, life's lore and wealth a dream, 
 and all the world a dream. 
 a woman waits for me she contains all, nothing is lacking, 
 yet all were lacking, if sex were lacking, or if the moisture of the right man were 
 	  lacking. 
 	 
 sex contains all, 
 bodies, souls, meanings, proofs, purities, delicacies, results, promulgations, 
 songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal mystery, the seminal milk; 
 all hopes, benefactions, bestowals, 
 all the passions, loves, beauties, delights of the earth, 
 all the governments, judges, gods, follow'd persons of the earth, 
 these are contain'd in sex, as parts of itself, and justifications of itself. 
 	 
 without shame the man i like knows and avows the deliciousness of his sex, 
 without shame the woman i like knows and avows hers. 
 	 
 now i will dismiss myself from impassive women, 
 i will go stay with her who waits for me, and with those women that are warm blooded and 
 	  sufficient for me; 
 i see that they understand me, and do not deny me; 
 i see that they are worthy of me i will be the robust husband of those women. 
 	 
 they are not one jot less than i am, 
 they are tann'd in the face by shining suns and blowing winds, 
 their flesh has the old divine suppleness and strength, 
 they know how to swim, row, ride, wrestle, shoot, run, strike, retreat, advance, resist, 
 	  defend themselves, 
 they are ultimate in their own right they are calm, clear, well possess'd of 
 	  themselves. 
 	 
 i draw you close to me, you women! 
 i cannot let you go, i would do you good, 
 i am for you, and you are for me, not only for our own sake, but for others' sakes; 
 envelop'd in you sleep greater heroes and bards, 
 they refuse to awake at the touch of any man but me. 
 	 
 it is i, you women i make my way, 
 i am stern, acrid, large, undissuadable but i love you, 
 i do not hurt you any more than is necessary for you, 
 i pour the stuff to start sons and daughters fit for these states i press with slow 
 	  rude muscle, 
 i brace myself effectually i listen to no entreaties, 
 i dare not withdraw till i deposit what has so long accumulated within me. 
 	 
 through you i drain the pent up rivers of myself, 
 in you i wrap a thousand onward years, 
 on you i graft the grafts of the best beloved of me and america, 
 the drops i distil upon you shall grow fierce and athletic girls, new artists, musicians, 
 	  and singers, 
 the babes i beget upon you are to beget babes in their turn, 
 i shall demand perfect men and women out of my love spendings, 
 i shall expect them to interpenetrate with others, as i and you interpenetrate now, 
 i shall count on the fruits of the gushing showers of them, as i count on the fruits of 
 	  the gushing showers i give now, 
 i shall look for loving crops from the birth, life, death, immortality, i plant so 
 	  lovingly now. 
 1 
 a great year and place; 
 a harsh, discordant, natal scream out sounding, to touch the mother's heart closer 
 	  	  than 
 	  any yet. 
 	 
 i walk'd the shores of my eastern sea, 
 heard over the waves the little voice, 
 saw the divine infant, where she woke, mournfully wailing, amid the roar of cannon, 
 	  	  curses, 
 	  shouts, crash of falling buildings; 
 was not so sick from the blood in the gutters running nor from the single corpses, 
 	  	  nor 
 	  those in heaps, nor those borne away in the tumbrils; 
 was not so desperate at the battues of death was not so shock'd at the repeated 
 	  fusillades of the guns. 
 	 
 2 
 pale, silent, stern, what could i say to that long accrued retribution? 
 could i wish humanity different? 
 could i wish the people made of wood and stone? 
 or that there be no justice in destiny or time? 
 	 
 3 
 o liberty! o mate for me! 
 here too the blaze, the grape shot and the axe, in reserve, to fetch them out in case of 
 	  	  need; 
 here too, though long represt, can never be destroy'd; 
 here too could rise at last, murdering and extatic; 
 here too demanding full arrears of vengeance. 
 	 
 4 
 hence i sign this salute over the sea, 
 and i do not deny that terrible red birth and baptism, 
 but remember the little voice that i heard wailing and wait with perfect trust, no 
 	  	  matter 
 	  how long; 
 and from to day, sad and cogent, i maintain the bequeath'd cause, as for all lands, 
 and i send these words to paris with my love, 
 and i guess some chansonniers there will understand them, 
 for i guess there is latent music yet in france floods of it; 
 o i hear already the bustle of instruments they will soon be drowning all that would 
 	  interrupt them; 
 o i think the east wind brings a triumphal and free march, 
 it reaches hither it swells me to joyful madness, 
 i will run transpose it in words, to justify it, 
 i will yet sing a song for you, ma femme.

 weapon, shapely, naked, wan! 
 head from the mother's bowels drawn! 
 wooded flesh and metal bone! limb only one, and lip only one! 
 gray blue leaf by red heat grown! helve produced from a little seed sown! 
 resting the grass amid and upon, 
 to be lean'd, and to lean on. 
 	 
 strong shapes, and attributes of strong shapes masculine trades, sights and sounds; 
 long varied train of an emblem, dabs of music; 
 fingers of the organist skipping staccato over the keys of the great organ.

 welcome are all earth's lands, each for its kind; 
 welcome are lands of pine and oak; 
 welcome are lands of the lemon and fig; 
 welcome are lands of gold; 
 welcome are lands of wheat and maize welcome those of the grape; 
 welcome are lands of sugar and rice; 
 welcome the cotton lands welcome those of the white potato and sweet potato; 
 welcome are mountains, flats, sands, forests, prairies; 
 welcome the rich borders of rivers, table lands, openings; 
 welcome the measureless grazing lands welcome the teeming soil of orchards, flax, honey, 
 	  	  hemp; 
 	 
 welcome just as much the other more hard faced lands; 
 lands rich as lands of gold, or wheat and fruit lands; 
 lands of mines, lands of the manly and rugged ores; 
 lands of coal, copper, lead, tin, zinc; 
 lands of iron! lands of the make of the axe! 
 	 
 3 
 the log at the wood pile, the axe supported by it; 
 the sylvan hut, the vine over the doorway, the space clear'd for a garden, 
 the irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves, after the storm is lull'd, 
 the wailing and moaning at intervals, the thought of the sea, 
 the thought of ships struck in the storm, and put on their beam ends, and the cutting away 
 	  	  of 
 	  masts; 
 	 
 the sentiment of the huge timbers of old fashion'd houses and barns; 
 the remember'd print or narrative, the voyage at a venture of men, families, goods, 
 the disembarkation, the founding of a new city, 
 the voyage of those who sought a new england and found it the outset anywhere, 
 the settlements of the arkansas, colorado, ottawa, willamette, 
 the slow progress, the scant fare, the axe, rifle, saddle bags; 
 the beauty of all adventurous and daring persons, 
 the beauty of wood boys and wood men, with their clear untrimm'd faces, 
 the beauty of independence, departure, actions that rely on themselves, 
 the american contempt for statutes and ceremonies, the boundless impatience of restraint, 
 	 
 the loose drift of character, the inkling through random types, the solidification; 
 the butcher in the slaughter house, the hands aboard schooners and sloops, the raftsman, 
 	  	  the 
 	  pioneer, 
 lumbermen in their winter camp, day break in the woods, stripes of snow on the limbs of 
 	  	  trees, 
 	  the 
 	  occasional snapping, 
 the glad clear sound of one's own voice, the merry song, the natural life of the woods, 
 	  	  the 
 	  strong 
 	  day's work, 
 the blazing fire at night, the sweet taste of supper, the talk, the bed of hemlock boughs, 
 	  	  and 
 	  the 
 	  bear skin; 
 	 the house builder at work in cities or anywhere, 
 the preparatory jointing, squaring, sawing, mortising, 
 the hoist up of beams, the push of them in their places, laying them regular, 
 setting the studs by their tenons in the mortises, according as they were prepared, 
 the blows of mallets and hammers, the attitudes of the men, their curv'd limbs, 
 bending, standing, astride the beams, driving in pins, holding on by posts and braces, 
 the hook'd arm over the plate, the other arm wielding the axe, 
 the floor men forcing the planks close, to be nail'd, 
 their postures bringing their weapons downward on the bearers, 
 the echoes resounding through the vacant building; 
 the huge store house carried up in the city, well under way, 
 the six framing men, two in the middle, and two at each end, carefully bearing on their 
 	  shoulders a 
 	  heavy stick for a cross beam, 
 the crowded line of masons with trowels in their right hands, rapidly laying the long 
 	  side wall, two 
 	  hundred feet from front to rear, 
 the flexible rise and fall of backs, the continual click of the trowels striking the 
 	  	  bricks, 
 the bricks, one after another, each laid so workmanlike in its place, and set with a knock 
 	  	  of 
 	  the 
 	  trowel handle, 
 the piles of materials, the mortar on the mortar boards, and the steady replenishing by 
 	  	  the 
 	  hod men; 
 	 spar makers in the spar yard, the swarming row of well grown apprentices, 
 the swing of their axes on the square hew'd log, shaping it toward the shape of a mast, 
 the brisk short crackle of the steel driven slantingly into the pine, 
 the butter color'd chips flying off in great flakes and slivers, 
 the limber motion of brawny young arms and hips in easy costumes; 
 the constructor of wharves, bridges, piers, bulk heads, floats, stays against the sea; 
 	 the city fireman the fire that suddenly bursts forth in the close pack'd square, 
 the arriving engines, the hoarse shouts, the nimble stepping and daring, 
 the strong command through the fire trumpets, the falling in line, the rise and fall of 
 	  	  the 
 	  arms 
 	  forcing the water, 
 the slender, spasmic, blue white jets the bringing to bear of the hooks and ladders, and 
 	  	  their 
 	  execution, 
 the crash and cut away of connecting wood work, or through floors, if the fire smoulders 
 	  	  under 
 	  them, 
 	 
 the crowd with their lit faces, watching the glare and dense shadows; 
 	 the forger at his forge furnace, and the user of iron after him, 
 the maker of the axe large and small, and the welder and temperer, 
 the chooser breathing his breath on the cold steel, and trying the edge with his thumb, 
 the one who clean shapes the handle, and sets it firmly in the socket; 
 the shadowy processions of the portraits of the past users also, 
 the primal patient mechanics, the architects and engineers, 
 the far off assyrian edifice and mizra edifice, 
 the roman lictors preceding the consuls, 
 the antique european warrior with his axe in combat, 
 the uplifted arm, the clatter of blows on the helmeted head, 
 the death howl, the limpsey tumbling body, the rush of friend and foe thither, 
 the siege of revolted lieges determin'd for liberty, 
 the summons to surrender, the battering at castle gates, the truce and parley; 
 the sack of an old city in its time, 
 the bursting in of mercenaries and bigots tumultuously and disorderly, 
 roar, flames, blood, drunkenness, madness, 
 goods freely rifled from houses and temples, screams of women in the gripe of brigands, 
 craft and thievery of camp followers, men running, old persons despairing, 
 the hell of war, the cruelties of creeds, 
 the list of all executive deeds and words, just or unjust, 
 the power of personality, just or unjust.

 muscle and pluck forever! 
 what invigorates life, invigorates death, 
 and the dead advance as much as the living advance, 
 and the future is no more uncertain than the present, 
 and the roughness of the earth and of man encloses as much as the delicatesse of the earth 
 	  	  and 
 	  of 
 	  man, 
 and nothing endures but personal qualities. 
 what do you think endures? 
 do you think the great city endures? 
 or a teeming manufacturing state? or a prepared constitution? or the best built 
 	  	  steamships? 
 or hotels of granite and iron? or any chef d'oeuvres of engineering, forts, armaments? 
 	 
 away! these are not to be cherish'd for themselves; 
 they fill their hour, the dancers dance, the musicians play for them; 
 the show passes, all does well enough of course, 
 all does very well till one flash of defiance. 
 	 
 the great city is that which has the greatest man or woman; 
 if it be a few ragged huts, it is still the greatest city in the whole world. 
 	 
 5 
 the place where the great city stands is not the place of stretch'd wharves, docks, 
 	  manufactures, 
 	  deposits of produce, 
 nor the place of ceaseless salutes of new comers, or the anchor lifters of the departing, 
 	 
 nor the place of the tallest and costliest buildings, or shops selling goods from the rest 
 	  	  of 
 	  the 
 	  earth, 
 nor the place of the best libraries and schools nor the place where money is plentiest, 
 nor the place of the most numerous population. 
 	 
 where the city stands with the brawniest breed of orators and bards; 
 where the city stands that is beloved by these, and loves them in return, and understands 
 	  	  them; 
 	 
 where no monuments exist to heroes, but in the common words and deeds; 
 where thrift is in its place, and prudence is in its place; 
 where the men and women think lightly of the laws; 
 where the slave ceases, and the master of slaves ceases; 
 where the populace rise at once against the never ending audacity of elected persons; 
 where fierce men and women pour forth, as the sea to the whistle of death pours its 
 	  	  sweeping 
 	  and 
 	  unript waves; 
 where outside authority enters always after the precedence of inside authority; 
 where the citizen is always the head and ideal and president, mayor, governor, and what 
 	  	  not, 
 	  are 
 	  agents for pay; 
 where children are taught to be laws to themselves, and to depend on themselves; 
 where equanimity is illustrated in affairs; 
 where speculations on the soul are encouraged; 
 where women walk in public processions in the streets, the same as the men, 
 where they enter the public assembly and take places the same as the men; 
 where the city of the faithfulest friends stands; 
 where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes stands; 
 where the city of the healthiest fathers stands; 
 where the city of the best bodied mothers stands, 
 there the great city stands. 
 	 
 6 
 how beggarly appear arguments before a defiant deed! 
 how the floridness of the materials of cities shrivels before a man's or woman's look! 
 	 
 all waits, or goes by default, till a strong being appears; 
 a strong being is the proof of the race, and of the ability of the universe; 
 when he or she appears, materials are overaw'd, 
 the dispute on the soul stops, 
 the old customs and phrases are confronted, turn'd back, or laid away. 
 	 
 what is your money making now? what can it do now? 
 what is your respectability now? 
 what are your theology, tuition, society, traditions, statute books, now? 
 where are your jibes of being now? 
 where are your cavils about the soul now?

 a sterile landscape covers the ore there is as good as the best, for all the forbidding 
 	  appearance; 
 there is the mine, there are the miners; 
 the forge furnace is there, the melt is accomplish'd; the hammers men are at hand with 
 	  	  their 
 	  tongs 
 	  and hammers; 
 what always served, and always serves, is at hand. 
 	 
 than this, nothing has better served it has served all: 
 served the fluent tongued and subtle sensed greek, and long ere the greek: 
 served in building the buildings that last longer than any; 
 served the hebrew, the persian, the most ancient hindostanee; 
 served the mound raiser on the mississippi served those whose relics remain in central 
 	  america; 
 served albic temples in woods or on plains, with unhewn pillars, and the druids; 
 served the artificial clefts, vast, high, silent, on the snow cover'd hills of 
 	  	  scandinavia; 
 served those who, time out of mind, made on the granite walls rough sketches of the sun, 
 	  	  moon, 
 	  stars, ships, ocean waves; 
 served the paths of the irruptions of the goths served the pastoral tribes and nomads; 
 served the long, long distant kelt served the hardy pirates of the baltic; 
 served before any of those, the venerable and harmless men of ethiopia; 
 served the making of helms for the galleys of pleasure, and the making of those for war; 
 served all great works on land, and all great works on the sea; 
 for the mediã¦val ages, and before the mediã¦val ages; 
 served not the living only, then as now, but served the dead.

 i see the european headsman; 
 he stands mask'd, clothed in red, with huge legs, and strong naked arms, 
 and leans on a ponderous axe. 
 	 
 (whom have you slaughter'd lately, european headsman? 
 whose is that blood upon you, so wet and sticky?) 
 	 
 i see the clear sunsets of the martyrs; 
 i see from the scaffolds the descending ghosts, 
 ghosts of dead lords, uncrown'd ladies, impeach'd ministers, rejected kings, 
 rivals, traitors, poisoners, disgraced chieftains, and the rest. 
 	 
 i see those who in any land have died for the good cause; 
 the seed is spare, nevertheless the crop shall never run out; 
 (mind you, o foreign kings, o priests, the crop shall never run out.) 
 	 
 i see the blood wash'd entirely away from the axe; 
 both blade and helve are clean; 
 they spirt no more the blood of european nobles they clasp no more the necks of queens. 
 	 
 i see the headsman withdraw and become useless; 
 i see the scaffold untrodden and mouldy i see no longer any axe upon it; 
 i see the mighty and friendly emblem of the power of my own race the newest, largest race.

 the shapes arise! 
 shapes of the using of axes anyhow, and the users, and all that neighbors them, 
 cutters down of wood, and haulers of it to the penobscot or kennebec, 
 dwellers in cabins among the california mountains, or by the little lakes, or on the 
 	  	  columbia, 
 	 
 dwellers south on the banks of the gila or rio grande friendly gatherings, the characters 
 	  	  and

 dwellers up north in minnesota and by the yellowstone river dwellers on coasts and off

 seal fishers, whalers, arctic seamen breaking passages through the ice. 
 	 
 the shapes arise! 
 shapes of factories, arsenals, foundries, markets; 
 shapes of the two threaded tracks of railroads; 
 shapes of the sleepers of bridges, vast frameworks, girders, arches; 
 shapes of the fleets of barges, towns, lake and canal craft, river craft. 
 	 
 the shapes arise! 
 ship yards and dry docks along the eastern and western seas, and in many a bay and 
 	  	  by place, 
 the live oak kelsons, the pine planks, the spars, the hackmatack roots for knees, 
 the ships themselves on their ways, the tiers of scaffolds, the workmen busy outside and 
 	  inside, 
 the tools lying around, the great auger and little auger, the adze, bolt, line, square, 
 	  	  gouge, 
 	  and 
 	  bead plane. 
 	 
 10 
 the shapes arise! 
 the shape measur'd, saw'd, jack'd, join'd, stain'd, 
 the coffin shape for the dead to lie within in his shroud; 
 the shape got out in posts, in the bedstead posts, in the posts of the bride's bed; 
 the shape of the little trough, the shape of the rockers beneath, the shape of the babe's 
 	  cradle; 
 	 
 the shape of the floor planks, the floor planks for dancers' feet; 
 the shape of the planks of the family home, the home of the friendly parents and children, 
 	 
 the shape of the roof of the home of the happy young man and woman the roof over the 
 	  well married 
 	  young man and woman, 
 the roof over the supper joyously cook'd by the chaste wife, and joyously eaten by the 
 	  	  chaste 
 	  husband, content after his day's work. 
 	 
 the shapes arise! 
 the shape of the prisoner's place in the court room, and of him or her seated in the 
 	  	  place; 
 the shape of the liquor bar lean'd against by the young rum drinker and the old 
 	  	  rum drinker; 
 the shape of the shamed and angry stairs, trod by sneaking footsteps; 
 the shape of the sly settee, and the adulterous unwholesome couple; 
 the shape of the gambling board with its devilish winnings and losings;

 the sheriff at hand with his deputies, the silent and white lipp'd crowd, the dangling of 
 	  	  the 
 	  rope. 
 	 
 the shapes arise! 
 shapes of doors giving many exits and entrances; 
 the door passing the dissever'd friend, flush'd and in haste; 
 the door that admits good news and bad news; 
 the door whence the son left home, confident and puff'd up; 
 the door he enter'd again from a long and scandalous absence, diseas'd, broken down, 
 	  	  without 
 	  innocence, without means.

 her shape arises, 
 she, less guarded than ever, yet more guarded than ever; 
 the gross and soil'd she moves among do not make her gross and soil'd; 
 she knows the thoughts as she passes nothing is conceal'd from her; 
 she is none the less considerate or friendly therefor; 
 she is the best belov'd it is without exception she has no reason to fear, and she does 
 	  	  not 
 	  fear; 
 oaths, quarrels, hiccupp'd songs, smutty expressions, are idle to her as she passes; 
 she is silent she is possess'd of herself they do not offend her; 
 she receives them as the laws of nature receive them she is strong, 
 she too is a law of nature there is no law stronger than she is.

 the main shapes arise! 
 shapes of democracy, total result of centuries; 
 shapes, ever projecting other shapes; 
 shapes of turbulent manly cities; 
 shapes of the friends and home givers of the whole earth, 
 shapes bracing the earth, and braced with the whole earth. 
 you just maturing youth! you male or female! 
 remember the organic compact of these states, 
 remember the pledge of the old thirteen thenceforward to the rights, life, liberty, 
 	  	  equality of 
 	  man, 
 remember what was promulged by the founders, ratified by the states, signed in black and 
 	  	  white 
 	  by the commissioners, and read by washington at the head of the army, 
 remember the purposes of the founders, remember washington; 
 remember the copious humanity streaming from every direction toward america; 
 remember the hospitality that belongs to nations and men; (cursed be nation, woman, man, 
 	  without hospitality!) 
 remember, government is to subserve individuals, 
 not any, not the president, is to have one jot more than you or me, 
 not any habitan of america is to have one jot less than you or me. 
 	 
 anticipate when the thirty or fifty millions, are to become the hundred, or two hundred 
 	  millions, of equal freemen and freewomen, amicably joined. 
 	 
 recall ages one age is but a part ages are but a part; 
 recall the angers, bickerings, delusions, superstitions, of the idea of caste, 
 recall the bloody cruelties and crimes. 
 	 
 anticipate the best women; 
 i say an unnumbered new race of hardy and well defined women are to spread through all 
 	  	  these 
 	  states, 
 i say a girl fit for these states must be free, capable, dauntless, just the same as a 
 	  	  boy. 
 	 
 anticipate your own life retract with merciless power, 
 shirk nothing retract in time do you see those errors, diseases, weaknesses, 
 	  	  lies, 
 	  thefts? 
 do you see that lost character? do you see decay, consumption, rum drinking, dropsy, 
 	  fever, mortal cancer or inflammation? 
 do you see death, and the approach of death? 
 a batter'd, wreck'd old man, 
 thrown on this savage shore, far, far from home, 
 pent by the sea, and dark rebellious brows, twelve dreary months, 
 sore, stiff with many toils, sicken'd, and nigh to death, 
 i take my way along the island's edge, 
 venting a heavy heart. 
 	 
 i am too full of woe! 
 haply, i may not live another day; 
 i can not rest, o god i can not eat or drink or sleep, 
 till i put forth myself, my prayer, once more to thee, 
 breathe, bathe myself once more in thee commune with thee, 
 report myself once more to thee. 
 	 
 thou knowest my years entire, my life, 
 (my long and crowded life of active work not adoration merely;) 
 thou knowest the prayers and vigils of my youth; 
 thou knowest my manhood's solemn and visionary meditations; 
 thou knowest how, before i commenced, i devoted all to come to thee; 
 thou knowest i have in age ratified all those vows, and strictly kept them; 
 thou knowest i have not once lost nor faith nor ecstasy in thee; 
 (in shackles, prison'd, in disgrace, repining not, 
 accepting all from thee as duly come from thee.) 
 	 
 all my emprises have been fill'd with thee, 
 my speculations, plans, begun and carried on in thoughts of thee, 
 sailing the deep, or journeying the land for thee; 
 intentions, purports, aspirations mine leaving results to thee. 
 	 
 o i am sure they really come from thee! 
 the urge, the ardor, the unconquerable will, 
 the potent, felt, interior command, stronger than words, 
 a message from the heavens, whispering to me even in sleep, 
 these sped me on. 
 	 
 by me, and these, the work so far accomplish'd (for what has been, has been;) 
 by me earth's elder, cloy'd and stifled lands, uncloy'd, unloos'd; 
 by me the hemispheres rounded and tied the unknown to the known. 
 	 
 the end i know not it is all in thee; 
 or small, or great, i know not haply, what broad fields, what lands; 
 haply, the brutish, measureless human undergrowth i know, 
 transplanted there, may rise to stature, knowledge worthy thee; 
 haply the swords i know may there indeed be turn'd to reaping tools; 
 haply the lifeless cross i know europe's dead cross may bud and blossom 
 	  	  there. 
 	 
 one effort more my altar this bleak sand: 
 that thou, o god, my life hast lighted, 
 with ray of light, steady, ineffable, vouchsafed of thee, 
 (light rare, untellable lighting the very light! 
 beyond all signs, descriptions, languages!) 
 for that, o god be it my latest word here on my knees, 
 old, poor, and paralyzed i thank thee. 
 	 
 my terminus near, 
 the clouds already closing in upon me, 
 the voyage balk'd the course disputed, lost, 
 i yield my ships to thee. 
 	 
 steersman unseen! henceforth the helms are thine; 
 take thou command (what to my petty skill thy navigation?) 
 my hands, my limbs grow nerveless; 
 my brain feels rack'd, bewilder'd; let the old timbers part i will not 
 	  	  part! 
 i will cling fast to thee, o god, though the waves buffet me; 
 thee, thee, at least, i know. 
 	 
 is it the prophet's thought i speak, or am i raving? 
 what do i know of life? what of myself? 
 i know not even my own work, past or present; 
 dim, ever shifting guesses of it spread before me, 
 of newer, better worlds, their mighty parturition, 
 mocking, perplexing me. 
 	 
 and these things i see suddenly what mean they? 
 as if some miracle, some hand divine unseal'd my eyes, 
 shadowy, vast shapes, smile through the air and sky, 
 and on the distant waves sail countless ships, 
 and anthems in new tongues i hear saluting me. 
 full of life, now, compact, visible, 
 i, forty years old the eighty third year of the states, 
 to one a century hence, or any number of centuries hence, 
 to you, yet unborn, these, seeking you. 
 	 
 when you read these, i, that was visible, am become invisible; 
 now it is you, compact, visible, realizing my poems, seeking me; 
 fancying how happy you were, if i could be with you, and become your comrade; 
 be it as if i were with you. (be not too certain but i am now with you.) 
 1 
 come up from the fields, father, here's a letter from our pete; 
 and come to the front door, mother here's a letter from thy dear son. 
 	 
 2 
 lo, 'tis autumn; 
 lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder, 
 cool and sweeten ohio's villages, with leaves fluttering in the moderate wind; 
 where apples ripe in the orchards hang, and grapes on the trellis'd vines; 
 (smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines? 
 smell you the buckwheat, where the bees were lately buzzing?) 
 	 
 above all, lo, the sky, so calm, so transparent after the rain, and with wondrous clouds; 
 below, too, all calm, all vital and beautiful and the farm prospers well. 
 	 
 3 
 down in the fields all prospers well; 
 but now from the fields come, father come at the daughter's call; 
 and come to the entry, mother to the front door come, right away. 
 	 
 fast as she can she hurries something ominous her steps trembling; 
 she does not tarry to smoothe her hair, nor adjust her cap. 
 	 
 open the envelope quickly; 
 o this is not our son's writing, yet his name is sign'd; 
 o a strange hand writes for our dear son o stricken mother's soul! 
 all swims before her eyes flashes with black she catches the main words only; 
 sentences broken gun shot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish, taken to 
 	  	  hospital, 
 at present low, but will soon be better. 
 	 
 4 
 ah, now, the single figure to me, 
 amid all teeming and wealthy ohio, with all its cities and farms, 
 sickly white in the face, and dull in the head, very faint, 
 by the jamb of a door leans. 
 	 
 grieve not so, dear mother, (the just grown daughter speaks through her sobs; 
 the little sisters huddle around, speechless and dismay'd;) 
 see, dearest mother, the letter says pete will soon be better. 
 	 
 5 
 alas, poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may be needs to be better, that brave and 
 	  	  simple 
 	  soul;) 
 while they stand at home at the door, he is dead already; 
 the only son is dead. 
 	 
 but the mother needs to be better; 
 she, with thin form, presently drest in black; 
 by day her meals untouch'd then at night fitfully sleeping, often waking, 
 in the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing, 
 o that she might withdraw unnoticed silent from life, escape and withdraw, 
 to follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son. 
 look down, fair moon, and bathe this scene; 
 pour softly down night's nimbus floods, on faces ghastly, swollen, purple; 
 on the dead, on their backs, with their arms toss'd wide, 
 pour down your unstinted nimbus, sacred moon. 
 1 
 o to make the most jubilant poem! 
 even to set off these, and merge with these, the carols of death. 
 o full of music! full of manhood, womanhood, infancy! 
 full of common employments! full of grain and trees. 
 	 
 o for the voices of animals! o for the swiftness and balance of fishes! 
 o for the dropping of rain drops in a poem! 
 o for the sunshine, and motion of waves in a poem. 
 	 
 o the joy of my spirit! it is uncaged! it darts like lightning! 
 it is not enough to have this globe, or a certain time i will have thousands of 
 	  	  globes, 
 	  and all time. 
 	 
 2 
 o the engineer's joys! 
 to go with a locomotive! 
 to hear the hiss of steam the merry shriek the steam whistle the laughing 
 	  locomotive! 
 to push with resistless way, and speed off in the distance. 
 	 
 o the gleesome saunter over fields and hill sides! 
 the leaves and flowers of the commonest weeds the moist fresh stillness of the woods, 
 the exquisite smell of the earth at day break, and all through the forenoon. 
 	 
 o the horseman's and horsewoman's joys! 
 the saddle the gallop the pressure upon the seat the cool gurgling by the 
 	  	  ears 
 	  and hair. 
 	 
 3 
 o the fireman's joys! 
 i hear the alarm at dead of night, 
 i hear bells shouts! i pass the crowd i run! 
 the sight of the flames maddens me with pleasure. 
 	 
 o the joy of the strong brawn'd fighter, towering in the arena, in perfect condition, 
 	  conscious of power, thirsting to meet his opponent. 
 	 
 o the joy of that vast elemental sympathy which only the human soul is capable of 
 	  	  generating 
 	  and emitting in steady and limitless floods. 
 	 
 4 
 o the mother's joys! 
 the watching the endurance the precious love the anguish the patiently 
 	  yielded life. 
 	 
 o the joy of increase, growth, recuperation; 
 the joy of soothing and pacifying the joy of concord and harmony. 
 	 
 o to go back to the place where i was born! 
 to hear the birds sing once more! 
 to ramble about the house and barn, and over the fields, once more, 
 and through the orchard and along the old lanes once more. 
 	 
 5 
 o male and female! 
 o the presence of women! (i swear there is nothing more exquisite to me than the mere 
 	  	  presence 
 	  of women;) 
 o for the girl, my mate! o for the happiness with my mate! 
 o the young man as i pass! o i am sick after the friendship of him who, i fear, is 
 	  	  indifferent 
 	  to me. 
 	 
 o the streets of cities! 
 the flitting faces the expressions, eyes, feet, costumes! o i cannot tell how welcome 
 	  	  they 
 	  are to me. 
 	 
 6 
 o to have been brought up on bays, lagoons, creeks, or along the coast! 
 o to continue and be employ'd there all my life! 
 o the briny and damp smell the shore the salt weeds exposed at low water, 
 the work of fishermen the work of the eel fisher and clam fisher. 
 	 
 o it is i! 
 i come with my clam rake and spade! i come with my eel spear; 
 is the tide out? i join the group of clam diggers on the flats, 
 i laugh and work with them i joke at my work, like a mettlesome young man. 
 	 
 in winter i take my eel basket and eel spear and travel out on foot on the ice i have 
 	  	  a 
 	  small axe to cut holes in the ice; 
 behold me, well clothed, going gaily, or returning in the afternoon my brood of tough 
 	  	  boys 
 	  accompaning me, 
 my brood of grown and part grown boys, who love to be with no one else so well as they 
 	  	  love to 
 	  be with me, 
 by day to work with me, and by night to sleep with me. 
 	 
 or, another time, in warm weather, out in a boat, to lift the lobster pots, where they are 
 	  	  sunk 
 	  with heavy stones, (i know the buoys;) 
 o the sweetness of the fifth month morning upon the water, as i row, just before sunrise, 
 	  toward the buoys; 
 i pull the wicker pots up slantingly the dark green lobsters are desperate with their 
 	  claws, as i take them out i insert wooden pegs in the joints of their pincers, 
 i go to all the places, one after another, and then row back to the shore, 
 there, in a huge kettle of boiling water, the lobsters shall be boil'd till their 
 	  	  color 
 	  becomes scarlet. 
 	 
 or, another time, mackerel taking, 
 voracious, mad for the hook, near the surface, they seem to fill the water for miles: 
 or, another time, fishing for rock fish, in chesapeake bay i one of the brown faced 
 	  	  crew: 
 or, another time, trailing for blue fish off paumanok, i stand with braced body, 
 my left foot is on the gunwale my right arm throws the coils of slender rope, 
 in sight around me the quick veering and darting of fifty skiffs, my companions. 
 	 
 7 
 o boating on the rivers! 
 the voyage down the niagara, (the st. lawrence,) the superb scenery the 
 	  	  steamers, 
 the ships sailing the thousand islands the occasional timber raft, and the 
 	  	  raftsmen 
 	  with long reaching sweep oars, 
 the little huts on the rafts, and the stream of smoke when they cook their supper at 
 	  	  evening. 
 	 
 o something pernicious and dread! 
 something far away from a puny and pious life! 
 something unproved! something in a trance! 
 something escaped from the anchorage, and driving free. 
 	 
 o to work in mines, or forging iron! 
 foundry casting the foundry itself the rude high roof the ample and 
 	  shadow'd space, 
 the furnace the hot liquid pour'd out and running. 
 	 
 8 
 o to resume the joys of the soldier: 
 to feel the presence of a brave general! to feel his sympathy! 
 to behold his calmness! to be warm'd in the rays of his smile! 
 to go to battle! to hear the bugles play, and the drums beat! 
 to hear the crash of artillery! to see the glittering of the bayonets and musket barrels 
 	  	  in the 
 	  sun! 
 to see men fall and die, and not complain! 
 to taste the savage taste of blood! to be so devilish! 
 to gloat so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy. 
 	 
 9 
 o the whaleman's joys! o i cruise my old cruise again! 
 i feel the ship's motion under me i feel the atlantic breezes fanning me, 
 i hear the cry again sent down from the mast head there she blows! 
 	 again i spring up the rigging, to look with the rest we see we descend, 
 	  	  wild 
 	  with excitement, 
 i leap in the lower'd boat we row toward our prey, where he lies, 
 we approach, stealthy and silent i see the mountainous mass, lethargic, basking, 
 i see the harpooneer standing up i see the weapon dart from his vigorous arm: 
 o swift, again, now, far out in the ocean, the wounded whale, settling, running to 
 	  	  windward, 
 	  tows me; 
 	 again i see him rise to breathe we row close again, 
 i see a lance driven through his side, press'd deep, turn'd in the wound, 
 again we back off i see him settle again the life is leaving him fast, 
 as he rises, he spouts blood i see him swim in circles narrower and narrower, swiftly 
 	  cutting the water i see him die; 
 he gives one convulsive leap in the centre of the circle, and then falls flat and still in 
 	  	  the 
 	  bloody foam. 
 	 
 10 
 o the old manhood of me, my joy! 
 my children and grand children my white hair and beard, 
 my largeness, calmness, majesty, out of the long stretch of my life. 
 	 
 o the ripen'd joy of womanhood! 
 o perfect happiness at last! 
 i am more than eighty years of age my hair, too, is pure white i am the most 
 	  venerable mother; 
 how clear is my mind! how all people draw nigh to me! 
 what attractions are these, beyond any before? what bloom, more than the bloom of youth? 
 what beauty is this that descends upon me, and rises out of me? 
 	 
 o the orator's joys! 
 to inflate the chest to roll the thunder of the voice out from the ribs and throat, 
 to make the people rage, weep, hate, desire, with yourself, 
 to lead america to quell america with a great tongue. 
 	 
 o the joy of my soul leaning pois'd on itself receiving identity through 
 	  	  materials, 
 	  and loving them observing characters, and absorbing them; 
 o my soul, vibrated back to me, from them from facts, sight, hearing, touch, my 
 	  phrenology, reason, articulation, comparison, memory, and the like; 
 the real life of my senses and flesh, transcending my senses and flesh; 
 my body, done with materials my sight, done with my material eyes; 
 proved to me this day, beyond cavil, that it is not my material eyes which finally see, 
 nor my material body which finally loves, walks, laughs, shouts, embraces, procreates. 
 	 
 11 
 o the farmer's joys! 
 ohioan's, illinoisian's, wisconsinese', kanadian's, iowan's, 
 	  kansian's, missourian's, oregonese' joys; 
 to rise at peep of day, and pass forth nimbly to work, 
 to plow land in the fall for winter sown crops, 
 to plough land in the spring for maize, 
 to train orchards to graft the trees to gather apples in the fall. 
 	 
 o the pleasure with trees! 
 the orchard the forest the oak, cedar, pine, pekan tree, 
 the honey locust, black walnut, cottonwood, and magnolia. 
 	 
 12 
 o death! the voyage of death! 
 the beautiful touch of death, soothing and benumbing a few moments, for reasons; 
 myself, discharging my excrementitious body, to be burn'd, or render'd to 
 	  	  powder, or 
 	  buried, 
 my real body doubtless left to me for other spheres, 
 my voided body, nothing more to me, returning to the purifications, further offices, 
 	  	  eternal 
 	  uses of the earth. 
 	 
 13 
 o to bathe in the swimming bath, or in a good place along shore! 
 to splash the water! to walk ankle deep to race naked along the shore. 
 	 
 o to realize space! 
 the plenteousness of all that there are no bounds; 
 to emerge, and be of the sky of the sun and moon, and the flying clouds, as one with 
 	  	  them. 
 	 
 	 
 o the joy of a manly self hood! 
 personality to be servile to none to defer to none not to any tyrant, known 
 	  	  or 
 	  unknown, 
 to walk with erect carriage, a step springy and elastic, 
 to look with calm gaze, or with a flashing eye, 
 to speak with a full and sonorous voice, out of a broad chest, 
 to confront with your personality all the other personalities of the earth.

 know'st thou the excellent joys of youth? 
 joys of the dear companions, and of the merry word, and laughing face? 
 joys of the glad, light beaming day joy of the wide breath'd games? 
 joy of sweet music joy of the lighted ball room, and the dancers? 
 joy of the friendly, plenteous dinner the strong carouse, and drinking? 
 	 
 15 
 yet, o my soul supreme! 
 know'st thou the joys of pensive thought? 
 joys of the free and lonesome heart the tender, gloomy heart? 
 joy of the solitary walk the spirit bowed yet proud the suffering and the 
 	  	  struggle? 
 the agonistic throes, the extasies joys of the solemn musings, day or night? 
 joys of the thought of death the great spheres time and space? 
 prophetic joys of better, loftier love's ideals the divine wife the sweet, 
 	  eternal, perfect comrade? 
 joys all thine own, undying one joys worthy thee, o soul. 
 	 
 16 
 o, while i live, to be the ruler of life not a slave, 
 to meet life as a powerful conqueror, 
 no fumes no ennui no more complaints, or scornful criticisms. 
 	 
 o me repellent and ugly! 
 to these proud laws of the air, the water, and the ground, proving my interior soul 
 	  impregnable, 
 and nothing exterior shall ever take command of me. 
 	 
 o to attract by more than attraction! 
 how it is i know not yet behold! the something which obeys none of the rest, 
 it is offensive, never defensive yet how magnetic it draws. 
 	 
 17 
 o joy of suffering! 
 to struggle against great odds! to meet enemies undaunted! 
 to be entirely alone with them! to find how much one can stand! 
 to look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, death, face to face! 
 to mount the scaffold! to advance to the muzzles of guns with perfect nonchalance! 
 to be indeed a god! 
 	 
 18 
 o, to sail to sea in a ship! 
 to leave this steady, unendurable land! 
 to leave the tiresome sameness of the streets, the sidewalks and the houses; 
 to leave you, o you solid motionless land, and entering a ship, 
 to sail, and sail, and sail! 
 	 
 19 
 o to have my life henceforth a poem of new joys! 
 to dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, roll on, float on, 
 to be a sailor of the world, bound for all ports, 
 a ship itself, (see indeed these sails i spread to the sun and air,) 
 a swift and swelling ship, full of rich words full of joys. 
 ashes of soldiers! 
 as i muse, retrospective, murmuring a chant in thought, 
 lo! the war resumes again to my sense your shapes, 
 and again the advance of armies. 
 	 
 noiseless as mists and vapors, 
 from their graves in the trenches ascending, 
 from the cemeteries all through virginia and tennessee, 
 from every point of the compass, out of the countless unnamed graves, 
 in wafted clouds, in myraids large, or squads of twos or threes, or single ones, they 
 	  	  come, 
 and silently gather round me. 
 	 
 now sound no note, o trumpeters! 
 not at the head of my cavalry, parading on spirited horses, 
 with sabres drawn and glist'ning, and carbines by their thighs (ah, my brave 
 	  horsemen! 
 my handsome, tan faced horsemen! what life, what joy and pride, 
 with all the perils, were yours!) 
 	 
 nor you drummers neither at reveille, at dawn, 
 nor the long roll alarming the camp nor even the muffled beat for a burial; 
 nothing from you, this time, o drummers, bearing my warlike drums. 
 	 
 but aside from these, and the marts of wealth, and the crowded promenade, 
 admitting around me comrades close, unseen by the rest, and voiceless, 
 the slain elate and alive again the dust and debris alive, 
 i chant this chant of my silent soul, in the name of all dead soldiers. 
 	 
 faces so pale, with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet; 
 draw close, but speak not. 
 	 
 phantoms of countless lost! 
 invisible to the rest, henceforth become my companions! 
 follow me ever! desert me not, while i live. 
 	 
 sweet are the blooming cheeks of the living! sweet are the musical voices sounding! 
 but sweet, ah sweet, are the dead, with their silent eyes. 
 	 
 dearest comrades! all is over and long gone; 
 but love is not over and what love, o comrades! 
 perfume from battle fields rising up from foetor arising. 
 	 
 perfume therefore my chant, o love! immortal love! 
 give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers, 
 shroud them, embalm them, cover them all over with tender pride! 
 	 
 perfume all! make all wholesome! 
 make these ashes to nourish and blossom, 
 o love! o chant! solve all, fructify all with the last chemistry. 
 	 
 give me exhaustless make me a fountain, 
 that i exhale love from me wherever i go, like a moist perennial dew, 
 for the ashes of all dead soldiers. 
 thee for my recitative! 
 thee in the driving storm, even as now the snow the winter day declining; 
 thee in thy panoply, thy measured dual throbbing, and thy beat convulsive; 
 thy black cylindric body, golden brass, and silvery steel; 
 thy ponderous side bars, parallel and connecting rods, gyrating, shuttling at thy sides; 
 thy metrical, now swelling pant and roar now tapering in the distance; 
 thy great protruding head light, fix'd in front; 
 thy long, pale, floating vapor pennants, tinged with delicate purple; 
 the dense and murky clouds out belching from thy smoke stack; 
 thy knitted frame thy springs and valves the tremulous twinkle of thy wheels; 
 thy train of cars behind, obedient, merrily following, 
 through gale or calm, now swift, now slack, yet steadily careering: 
 type of the modern! emblem of motion and power! pulse of the continent! 
 for once, come serve the muse, and merge in verse, even as here i see thee, 
 with storm, and buffeting gusts of wind, and falling snow; 
 by day, thy warning, ringing bell to sound its notes, 
 by night, thy silent signal lamps to swing. 
 	 
 fierce throated beauty! 
 roll through my chant, with all thy lawless music! thy swinging lamps at night; 
 thy piercing, madly whistled laughter! thy echoes, rumbling like an earthquake, rousing 
 	  	  all! 
 law of thyself complete, thine own track firmly holding; 
 (no sweetness debonair of tearful harp or glib piano thine,) 
 thy trills of shrieks by rocks and hills return'd, 
 launch'd o'er the prairies wide across the lakes, 
 to the free skies, unpent, and glad, and strong.

 such gliding wonders! such sights and sounds! 
 such join'd unended links, each hook'd to the next! 
 each answering all each sharing the earth with all. 
 	 
 what widens within you, walt whitman?

 within me latitude widens, longitude lengthens;

 stretch'd in due time within me the midnight sun just rises above the horizon, and sinks 
 	  	  again;

 	  	  to 
 	  this 
 	  day, from poets who wrote three thousand years ago.

 a california song! 
 a prophecy and indirection a thought impalpable, to breathe, as air; 
 a chorus of dryads, fading, departing or hamadryads departing; 
 a murmuring, fateful, giant voice, out of the earth and sky, 
 voice of a mighty dying tree in the redwood forest dense. 
 	 
 farewell, my brethren, 
 farewell, o earth and sky farewell, ye neighboring waters; 
 my time has ended, my term has come. 
 	 
 2 
 along the northern coast, 
 just back from the rock bound shore, and the caves, 
 in the saline air from the sea, in the mendocino country, 
 with the surge for bass and accompaniment low and hoarse, 
 with crackling blows of axes, sounding musically, driven by strong arms, 
 riven deep by the sharp tongues of the axes there in the redwood forest dense, 
 i heard the mighty tree its death chant chanting. 
 	 
 the choppers heard not the camp shanties echoed not; 
 the quick ear'd teamsters, and chain and jack screw men, heard not, 
 as the wood spirits came from their haunts of a thousand years, to join the refrain; 
 but in my soul i plainly heard. 
 	 
 murmuring out of its myriad leaves, 
 down from its lofty top, rising two hundred feet high, 
 out of its stalwart trunk and limbs out of its foot thick bark, 
 that chant of the seasons and time chant, not of the past only, but the future. 
 	 
 3 
 you untold life of me, 
 and all you venerable and innocent joys, 
 perennial, hardy life of me, with joys, 'mid rain, and many a summer sun, 
 and the white snows, and night, and the wild winds; 
 o the great patient, rugged joys! my soul's strong joys, unreck'd by man; 
 (for know i bear the soul befitting me i too have consciousness, identity, 
 and all the rocks and mountains have and all the earth;) 
 joys of the life befitting me and brothers mine, 
 our time, our term has come. 
 	 
 nor yield we mournfully, majestic brothers, 
 we who have grandly fill'd our time; 
 with nature's calm content, and tacit, huge delight, 
 we welcome what we wrought for through the past, 
 and leave the field for them. 
 	 
 for them predicted long, 
 for a superber race they too to grandly fill their time, 
 for them we abdicate in them ourselves, ye forest kings! 
 in them these skies and airs these mountain peaks shasta nevadas, 
 these huge, precipitous cliffs this amplitude these valleys grand yosemite, 
 to be in them absorb'd, assimilated. 
 	 
 4 
 then to a loftier strain, 
 still prouder, more ecstatic, rose the chant, 
 as if the heirs, the deities of the west, 
 joining, with master tongue, bore part. 
 	 
 not wan from asia's fetishes, 
 nor red from europe's old dynastic slaughter house, 
 (area of murder plots of thrones, with scent left yet of wars and scaffolds every 
 	  where,) 
 but come from nature's long and harmless throes peacefully builded thence, 
 these virgin lands lands of the western shore, 
 to the new culminating man to you, the empire new, 
 you, promis'd long, we pledge, we dedicate. 
 	 
 you occult, deep volitions, 
 you average spiritual manhood, purpose of all, pois'd on yourself giving, not taking 
 	  law, 
 you womanhood divine, mistress and source of all, whence life and love, and aught that 
 	  	  comes 
 	  from life and love, 
 you unseen moral essence of all the vast materials of america, (age upon age, 
 	  	  working 
 	  in death the same as life,) 
 you that, sometimes known, oftener unknown, really shape and mould the new world, 
 	  	  adjusting 
 	  it to time and space, 
 you hidden national will, lying in your abysms, conceal'd, but ever alert, 
 you past and present purposes, tenaciously pursued, may be unconscious of 
 	  	  yourselves, 
 unswerv'd by all the passing errors, perturbations of the surface; 
 you vital, universal, deathless germs, beneath all creeds, arts, statutes, 
 	  	  literatures, 
 	 
 here build your homes for good establish here these areas entire, lands of the western 
 	  shore, 
 we pledge, we dedicate to you. 
 	 
 for man of you your characteristic race, 
 here may be hardy, sweet, gigantic grow here tower, proportionate to nature, 
 here climb the vast, pure spaces, unconfined, uncheck'd by wall or roof, 
 here laugh with storm or sun here joy here patiently inure, 
 here heed himself, unfold himself (not others' formulas heed) here fill 
 	  his time, 
 to duly fall, to aid, unreck'd at last, 
 to disappear, to serve. 
 	 
 thus, on the northern coast, 
 in the echo of teamsters' calls, and the clinking chains, and the music of choppers' axes, 
 	 
 the falling trunk and limbs, the crash, the muffled shriek, the groan, 
 such words combined from the redwood tree as of wood spirits' voices ecstatic, ancient and 
 	  rustling, 
 the century lasting, unseen dryads, singing, withdrawing, 
 all their recesses of forests and mountains leaving, 
 from the cascade range to the wasatch or idaho far, or utah, 
 to the deities of the modern henceforth yielding, 
 the chorus and indications, the vistas of coming humanity the settlements, features all, 
 in the mendocino woods i caught. 
 	 
 5 
 the flashing and golden pageant of california! 
 the sudden and gorgeous drama the sunny and ample lands; 
 the long and varied stretch from puget sound to colorado south; 
 lands bathed in sweeter, rarer, healthier air valleys and mountain cliffs; 
 the fields of nature long prepared and fallow the silent, cyclic chemistry; 
 the slow and steady ages plodding the unoccupied surface ripening the rich ores forming 
 	  beneath; 
 at last the new arriving, assuming, taking possession, 
 a swarming and busy race settling and organizing every where; 
 ships coming in from the whole round world, and going out to the whole world, 
 to india and china and australia, and the thousand island paradises of the pacific; 
 populous cities the latest inventions the steamers on the rivers the railroads with 
 	  many a thrifty farm, with machinery, 
 and wool, and wheat, and the grape and diggings of yellow gold. 
 	 
 6 
 but more in you than these, lands of the western shore! 
 (these but the means, the implements, the standing ground,) 
 i see in you, certain to come, the promise of thousands of years, till now deferr'd, 
 promis'd, to be fulfill'd, our common kind, the race. 
 	 
 the new society at last, proportionate to nature, 
 in man of you, more than your mountain peaks, or stalwart trees imperial, 
 in woman more, far more, than all your gold, or vines, or even vital air. 
 	 
 fresh come, to a new world indeed, yet long prepared, 
 i see the genius of the modern, child of the real and ideal, 
 clearing the ground for broad humanity, the true america, heir of the past so grand, 
 to build a grander future. 
 1 
 manhattan's streets i saunter'd, pondering, 
 on time, space, reality on such as these, and abreast with them, prudence. 
 	 
 2 
 after all, the last explanation remains to be made about prudence; 
 little and large alike drop quietly aside from the prudence that suits immortality. 
 	 
 the soul is of itself; 
 all verges to it all has reference to what ensues; 
 all that a person does, says, thinks, is of consequence; 
 not a move can a man or woman make, that affects him or her in a day, month, any part of 
 	  	  the 
 	  direct 
 	  life time, or the hour of death, but the same affects him or her onward afterward through 
 	  	  the 
 	  indirect life time. 
 	 
 3 
 the indirect is just as much as the direct, 
 the spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the body, if not more. 
 	 
 not one word or deed not venereal sore, discoloration, privacy of the onanist, 
 	  	  putridity 
 	  of 
 	  gluttons or rum drinkers, peculation, cunning, betrayal, murder, seduction, prostitution, 
 	  	  but 
 	  has 
 	  results beyond death, as really as before death. 
 	 
 4 
 charity and personal force are the only investments worth anything. 
 	 
 no specification is necessary all that a male or female does, that is vigorous, 
 	  benevolent, 
 	  clean, is so much profit to him or her, in the unshakable order of the universe, and 
 	  	  through 
 	  the 
 	  whole scope of it forever. 
 	 
 5 
 who has been wise, receives interest, 
 savage, felon, president, judge, farmer, sailor, mechanic, literat, young, old, it is the 
 	  	  same, 
 the interest will come round all will come round. 
 	 
 singly, wholly, to affect now, affected their time, will forever affect all of the past, 
 	  	  and 
 	  all of 
 	  the present, and all of the future, 
 all the brave actions of war and peace, 
 all help given to relatives, strangers, the poor, old, sorrowful, young children, widows, 
 	  	  the 
 	  sick, 
 	  and to shunn'd persons, 
 all furtherance of fugitives, and of the escape of slaves, 
 all self denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw others fill the seats of 
 	  	  the 
 	  boats, 
 all offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a friend's sake, or 
 	  opinion's sake, 
 all pains of enthusiasts, scoff'd at by their neighbors, 
 all the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers, 
 all honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded, 
 all the grandeur and good of ancient nations whose fragments we inherit, 
 all the good of the dozens of ancient nations unknown to us by name, date, location, 
 all that was ever manfully begun, whether it succeeded or no, 
 all suggestions of the divine mind of man, or the divinity of his mouth, or the shaping of 
 	  	  his 
 	  great 
 	  hands; 
 all that is well thought or said this day on any part of the globe or on any of the 
 	  wandering 
 	  stars, or on any of the fix'd stars, by those there as we are here; 
 all that is henceforth to be thought or done by you, whoever you are, or by any one; 
 these inure, have inured, shall inure, to the identities from which they sprang, or shall 
 	  spring. 
 	 
 6 
 did you guess anything lived only its moment? 
 the world does not so exist no parts palpable or impalpable so exist; 
 no consummation exists without being from some long previous consummation and that 
 	  	  from 
 	  some 
 	  other, 
 without the farthest conceivable one coming a bit nearer the beginning than any. 
 	 
 7 
 whatever satisfies souls is true; 
 prudence entirely satisfies the craving and glut of souls; 
 itself only finally satisfies the soul; 
 the soul has that measureless pride which revolts from every lesson but its own. 
 	 
 8 
 now i give you an inkling; 
 now i breathe the word of the prudence that walks abreast with time, space, reality, 
 that answers the pride which refuses every lesson but its own. 
 	 
 what is prudence, is indivisible, 
 declines to separate one part of life from every part, 
 divides not the righteous from the unrighteous, or the living from the dead, 
 matches every thought or act by its correlative, 
 knows no possible forgiveness, or deputed atonement, 
 knows that the young man who composedly peril'd his life and lost it, has done 
 	  	  exceedingly 
 	  well 
 	  for himself without doubt, 
 that he who never peril'd his life, but retains it to old age in riches and ease, has 
 	  probably 
 	  achiev'd nothing for himself worth mentioning; 
 knows that only that person has really learn'd, who has learn'd to prefer 
 	  	  results, 
 who favors body and soul the same, 
 who perceives the indirect assuredly following the direct, 
 who in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither hurries or, avoids death. 
 when i heard at the close of the day how my name had been receiv'd with plaudits in the 
 	  capitol, 
 	  still it was not a happy night for me that follow'd; 
 and else, when i carous'd, or when my plans were accomplish'd, still i was not happy; 
 but the day when i rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health, refresh'd, singing, 
 	  	  inhaling 
 	  the 
 	  ripe breath of autumn, 
 when i saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning light, 
 when i wander'd alone over the beach, and undressing, bathed, laughing with the cool 
 	  	  waters, 
 	  and 
 	  saw the sun rise, 
 and when i thought how my dear friend, my lover, was on his way coming, o then i was 
 	  	  happy; 
 o then each breath tasted sweeter and all that day my food nourish'd me more and the 
 	  	  beautiful 
 	  day pass'd well, 
 and the next came with equal joy and with the next, at evening, came my friend; 
 and that night, while all was still, i heard the waters roll slowly continually up the 
 	  	  shores, 
 	 
 i heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands, as directed to me, whispering, to 
 	  congratulate 
 	  me, 
 for the one i love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool night, 
 in the stillness, in the autumn moonbeams, his face was inclined toward me, 
 and his arm lay lightly around my breast and that night i was happy. 
 1 
 as i sat alone, by blue ontario's shore, 
 as i mused of these mighty days, and of peace return'd, and the dead that return no 
 	  	  more, 
 a phantom, gigantic, superb, with stern visage, accosted me; 
 chant me the poem, it said, that comes from the soul of america chant me 
 	  	  the 
 	  carol of victory; 
 and strike up the marches of libertad marches more powerful yet; 
 and sing me before you go, the song of the throes of democracy. 
 	 
 (democracy the destin'd conqueror yet treacherous lip smiles everywhere, 
 and death and infidelity at every step.) 
 	 
 2 
 a nation announcing itself, 
 i myself make the only growth by which i can be appreciated, 
 i reject none, accept all, then reproduce all in my own forms. 
 	 
 a breed whose proof is in time and deeds; 
 what we are, we are nativity is answer enough to objections; 
 we wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded, 
 we are powerful and tremendous in ourselves, 
 we are executive in ourselves we are sufficient in the variety of ourselves, 
 we are the most beautiful to ourselves, and in ourselves; 
 we stand self pois'd in the middle, branching thence over the world; 
 from missouri, nebraska, or kansas, laughing attacks to scorn. 
 	 
 nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves, 
 whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or sinful in ourselves only. 
 	 
 (o mother! o sisters dear! 
 if we are lost, no victor else has destroy'd us; 
 it is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.) 
 	 
 3 
 have you thought there could be but a single supreme? 
 there can be any number of supremes one does not countervail another, any more than 
 	  	  one 
 	  eyesight countervails another, or one life countervails another. 
 	 
 all is eligible to all, 
 all is for individuals all is for you, 
 no condition is prohibited not god's, or any. 
 	 
 all comes by the body only health puts you rapport with the universe. 
 	 
 produce great persons, the rest follows. 
 	 
 4 
 america isolated i sing; 
 i say that works made here in the spirit of other lands, are so much poison in the states. 
 	 
 	 
 (how dare such insects as we see assume to write poems for america? 
 for our victorious armies, and the offspring following the armies?) 
 	 
 piety and conformity to them that like! 
 peace, obesity, allegiance, to them that like! 
 i am he who tauntingly compels men, women, nations, 
 crying, leap from your seats, and contend for your lives! 
 	 
 i am he who walks the states with a barb'd tongue, questioning every one i meet; 
 who are you, that wanted only to be told what you knew before? 
 who are you, that wanted only a book to join you in your nonsense? 
 	 
 (with pangs and cries, as thine own, o bearer of many children! 
 these clamors wild, to a race of pride i give.) 
 	 
 o lands! would you be freer than all that has ever been before? 
 if you would be freer than all that has been before, come listen to me. 
 	 
 fear grace fear elegance, civilization, delicatesse, 
 fear the mellow sweet, the sucking of honey juice; 
 beware the advancing mortal ripening of nature, 
 beware what precedes the decay of the ruggedness of states and men. 
 	 
 ages, precedents, have long been accumulating undirected materials, 
 america brings builders, and brings its own styles. 
 	 
 the immortal poets of asia and europe have done their work, and pass'd to other 
 	  	  spheres, 
 a work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done. 
 	 
 america, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its own at all hazards, 
 stands removed, spacious, composite, sound initiates the true use of precedents, 
 does not repel them, or the past, or what they have produced under their forms, 
 takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly borne from the house, 
 perceives that it waits a little while in the door that it was fittest for its days, 
 that its life has descended to the stalwart and well shaped heir who approaches, 
 and that he shall be fittest for his days. 
 	 
 any period, one nation must lead, 
 one land must be the promise and reliance of the future. 
 	 
 these states are the amplest poem, 
 here is not merely a nation, but a teeming nation of nations, 
 here the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of the day and night, 
 here is what moves in magnificent masses, careless of particulars, 
 here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the soul loves, 
 here the flowing trains here the crowds, equality, diversity, the soul loves. 
 	 
 6 
 land of lands, and bards to corroborate! 
 of them, standing among them, one lifts to the light his west bred face, 
 to him the hereditary countenance bequeath'd, both mother's and father's, 
 his first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees, 
 built of the common stock, having room for far and near, 
 used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land, 
 attracting it body and soul to himself, hanging on its neck with incomparable love, 
 plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits, 
 making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal in him, 
 making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him, 
 mississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes columbia, niagara, hudson, 
 	  	  spending 
 	  themselves lovingly in him, 
 if the atlantic coast stretch, or the pacific coast stretch, he stretching with them north 
 	  	  or 
 	  south, 
 spanning between them, east and west, and touching whatever is between them, 
 growths growing from him to offset the growth of pine, cedar, hemlock, live oak, locust, 
 	  chestnut, hickory, cottonwood, orange, magnolia, 
 tangles as tangled in him as any cane brake or swamp, 
 he likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests coated with northern transparent ice, 
 off him pasturage, sweet and natural as savanna, upland, prairie, 
 through him flights, whirls, screams, answering those of the fish hawk, mocking bird, 
 	  night heron, and eagle; 
 his spirit surrounding his country's spirit, unclosed to good and evil, 
 surrounding the essences of real things, old times and present times, 
 surrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of red aborigines, 
 weather beaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo stature and muscle, 
 the haughty defiance of the year 1 war, peace, the formation of the constitution, 
 the separate states, the simple, elastic scheme, the immigrants, 
 the union, always swarming with blatherers, and always sure and impregnable, 
 the unsurvey'd interior, log houses, clearings, wild animals, hunters, trappers; 
 surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, temperature, the gestation of new states, 
 congress convening every twelfth month, the members duly coming up from the uttermost 
 	  	  parts; 
 surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers, especially the young men, 
 responding their manners, speech, dress, friendships the gait they have of persons 
 	  	  who 
 	  never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors, 
 the freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness and decision of their 
 	  phrenology, 
 the picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness when wrong'd, 
 the fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity, good temper, and 
 	  open handedness the whole composite make, 
 the prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large amativeness, 
 the perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid movement of the population, 
 the superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling, gold digging, 
 wharf hemm'd cities, railroad and steamboat lines, intersecting all points, 
 factories, mercantile life, labor saving machinery, the north east, north west, 
 	  	  south west, 
 manhattan firemen, the yankee swap, southern plantation life, 
 slavery the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the ruins of all the 
 	  	  rest; 
 on and on to the grapple with it assassin! then your life or ours be the 
 	  	  stake and 
 	  respite no more. 
 	 
 7 
 (lo! high toward heaven, this day, 
 libertad! from the conqueress' field return'd, 
 i mark the new aureola around your head; 
 no more of soft astral, but dazzling and fierce, 
 with war's flames, and the lambent lightnings playing, 
 and your port immovable where you stand; 
 with still the inextinguishable glance, and the clench'd and lifted fist, 
 and your foot on the neck of the menacing one, the scorner, utterly crush'd beneath 
 	  	  you; 
 the menacing, arrogant one, that strode and advanced with his senseless scorn, bearing the 
 	  murderous knife; 
 	 lo! the wide swelling one, the braggart, that would yesterday do so much! 
 to day a carrion dead and damn'd, the despised of all the earth! 
 an offal rank, to the dunghill maggots spurn'd.) 
 	 
 8 
 others take finish, but the republic is ever constructive, and ever keeps vista; 
 others adorn the past but you, o days of the present, i adorn you! 
 o days of the future, i believe in you! i isolate myself for your sake; 
 o america, because you build for mankind, i build for you! 
 o well beloved stone cutters! i lead them who plan with decision and science, 
 i lead the present with friendly hand toward the future. 
 	 
 bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the next age! 
 but damn that which spends itself, with no thought of the stain, pains, dismay, feebleness 
 	  	  it 
 	  is bequeathing. 
 	 
 9 
 i listened to the phantom by ontario's shore, 
 i heard the voice arising, demanding bards; 
 by them, all native and grand by them alone can the states be fused into the compact 
 	  organism of a nation. 
 	 
 to hold men together by paper and seal, or by compulsion, is no account; 
 that only holds men together which aggregates all in a living principle, as the hold of 
 	  	  the 
 	  limbs of the body, or the fibres of plants. 
 	 
 of all races and eras, these states, with veins full of poetical stuff, most need poets, 
 	  	  and 
 	  are to have the greatest, and use them the greatest; 
 their presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their poets shall. 
 	 
 (soul of love, and tongue of fire! 
 eye to pierce the deepest deeps, and sweep the world! 
 	 ah, mother! prolific and full in all besides yet how long barren, barren?) 
 	 
 10 
 of these states, the poet is the equable man, 
 not in him, but off from him, things are grotesque, eccentric, fail of their full returns, 
 	 
 nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad, 
 he bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion, neither more nor less, 
 he is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key, 
 he is the equalizer of his age and land, 
 he supplies what wants supplying he checks what wants checking, 
 in peace, out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich, thrifty, building populous 
 	  	  towns, 
 	  encouraging agriculture, arts, commerce, lighting the study of man, the soul, health, 
 	  immortality, government; 
 in war, he is the best backer of the war he fetches artillery as good as the 
 	  engineer's he can make every word he speaks draw blood; 
 the years straying toward infidelity, he withholds by his steady faith, 
 he is no argurer, he is judgment (nature accepts him absolutely;) 
 he judges not as the judge judges, but as the sun falling round a helpless thing; 
 as he sees the farthest, he has the most faith, 
 his thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things, 
 in the dispute on god and eternity he is silent, 
 he sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement, 
 he sees eternity in men and women he does not see men and women as dreams or dots. 
 	 
 for the great idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals, 
 for that idea the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders, 
 the attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign despots. 
 	 
 without extinction is liberty! without retrograde is equality! 
 they live in the feelings of young men, and the best women; 
 not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been always ready to fall for 
 	  	  liberty. 
 	 
 11 
 for the great idea! 
 that, o my brethren that is the mission of poets. 
 	 
 songs of stern defiance, ever ready, 
 songs of the rapid arming, and the march, 
 the flag of peace quick folded, and instead, the flag we know, 
 warlike flag of the great idea. 
 	 
 (angry cloth i saw there leaping! 
 i stand again in leaden rain, your flapping folds saluting; 
 i sing you over all, flying, beckoning through the fight o the hard contested fight! 
 o the cannons ope their rosy flashing muzzles! the hurtled balls scream! 
 	 
 the battle front forms amid the smoke the volleys pour incessant from the line; 
 hark! the ringing word, charge! now the tussle, and the furious maddening 
 	  	  yells; 
 now the corpses tumble curl'd upon the ground, 
 cold, cold in death, for precious life of you, 
 angry cloth i saw there leaping.) 
 	 
 12 
 are you he who would assume a place to teach, or be a poet here in the states? 
 the place is august the terms obdurate. 
 	 
 who would assume to teach here, may well prepare himself, body and mind, 
 he may well survey, ponder, arm, fortify, harden, make lithe, himself, 
 he shall surely be question'd beforehand by me with many and stern questions. 
 	 
 who are you, indeed, who would talk or sing to america? 
 have you studied out the land, its idioms and men? 
 have you learn'd the physiology, phrenology, politics, geography, pride, freedom, 
 	  friendship, of the land? its substratums and objects? 
 have you consider'd the organic compact of the first day of the first year of 
 	  independence, sign'd by the commissioners, ratified by the states, and read by 
 	  	  washington 
 	  at the head of the army? 
 have you possess'd yourself of the federal constitution? 
 do you see who have left all feudal processes and poems behind them, and assumed the poems 
 	  	  and 
 	  processes of democracy? 
 are you faithful to things? do you teach as the land and sea, the bodies of men, 
 	  	  womanhood, 
 	  amativeness, angers, teach? 
 have you sped through fleeting customs, popularities? 
 can you hold your hand against all seductions, follies, whirls, fierce contentions? are 
 	  	  you 
 	  very strong? are you really of the whole people? 
 are you not of some coterie? some school or mere religion? 
 are you done with reviews and criticisms of life? animating now to life itself? 
 have you vivified yourself from the maternity of these states? 
 have you too the old, ever fresh forbearance and impartiality? 
 do you hold the like love for those hardening to maturity; for the last born? little and 
 	  	  big? 
 	  and for the errant? 
 	 
 what is this you bring my america? 
 is it uniform with my country? 
 is it not something that has been better told or done before? 
 have you not imported this, or the spirit of it, in some ship? 
 is it not a mere tale? a rhyme? a prettiness? is the good old cause in it? 
 has it not dangled long at the heels of the poets, politicians, literats, of enemies' 
 	  lands? 
 does it not assume that what is notoriously gone is still here? 
 does it answer universal needs? will it improve manners? 
 does it sound, with trumpet voice, the proud victory of the union, in that secession war? 
 can your performance face the open fields and the seaside? 
 will it absorb into me as i absorb food, air to appear again in my strength, gait, 
 	  	  face? 
 have real employments contributed to it? original makers not mere amanuenses? 
 does it meet modern discoveries, calibers, facts face to face? 
 what does it mean to me? to american persons, progresses, cities? chicago, kanada, 
 	  	  arkansas? 
 	  the planter, yankee, georgian, native, immigrant, sailors, squatters, old states, new 
 	  	  states? 
 does it encompass all the states, and the unexceptional rights of all the men and women of 
 	  	  the 
 	  earth? (the genital impulse of these states;) 
 does it see behind the apparent custodians, the real custodians, standing, menacing, 
 	  silent the mechanics, manhattanese, western men, southerners, significant alike in 
 	  	  their 
 	  apathy, and in the promptness of their love? 
 does it see what finally befalls, and has always finally befallen, each temporizer, 
 	  	  patcher, 
 	  outsider, partialist, alarmist, infidel, who has ever ask'd anything of america? 
 what mocking and scornful negligence? 
 the track strew'd with the dust of skeletons; 
 by the roadside others disdainfully toss'd. 
 	 
 13 
 rhymes and rhymers pass away poems distill'd from foreign poems pass away, 
 the swarms of reflectors and the polite pass, and leave ashes; 
 admirers, importers, obedient persons, make but the soul of literature; 
 america justifies itself, give it time no disguise can deceive it, or conceal from 
 	  it it is impassive enough, 
 only toward the likes of itself will it advance to meet them, 
 if its poets appear, it will in due time advance to meet them there is no fear of 
 	  	  mistake, 
 	 
 (the proof of a poet shall be sternly deferr'd, till his country absorbs him as 
 	  affectionately as he has absorb'd it.) 
 	 
 he masters whose spirit masters he tastes sweetest who results sweetest in the long 
 	  	  run; 
 the blood of the brawn beloved of time is unconstraint; 
 in the need of poems, philosophy, politics, manners, engineering, an appropriate native 
 	  grand opera, shipcraft, any craft, he or she is greatest who contributes the greatest 
 	  	  original 
 	  practical example. 
 	 
 already a nonchalant breed, silently emerging, appears on the streets, 
 people's lips salute only doers, lovers, satisfiers, positive knowers; 
 there will shortly be no more priests i say their work is done, 
 death is without emergencies here, but life is perpetual emergencies here, 
 are your body, days, manners, superb? after death you shall be superb; 
 justice, health, self esteem, clear the way with irresistible power; 
 how dare you place anything before a man? 
 	 
 14 
 fall behind me, states! 
 a man before all myself, typical before all. 
 	 
 give me the pay i have served for! 
 give me to sing the song of the great idea! take all the rest; 
 i have loved the earth, sun, animals i have despised riches, 
 i have given alms to every one that ask'd, stood up for the stupid and crazy, devoted 
 	  	  my 
 	  income and labor to others, 
 i have hated tyrants, argued not concerning god, had patience and indulgence toward the 
 	  	  people, 
 	  taken off my hat to nothing known or unknown, 
 i have gone freely with powerful uneducated persons, and with the young, and with the 
 	  	  mothers 
 	  of families, 
 i have read these leaves to myself in the open air i have tried them by trees, stars, 
 	  rivers, 
 i have dismiss'd whatever insulted my own soul or defiled my body, 
 i have claim'd nothing to myself which i have not carefully claim'd for others 
 	  	  on the 
 	  same terms, 
 i have sped to the camps, and comrades found and accepted from every state; 
 (in war of you, as well as peace, my suit is good, america sadly i boast; 
 upon this breast has many a dying soldier lean'd, to breathe his last; 
 this arm, this hand, this voice, have nourish'd, rais'd, restored, 
 to life recalling many a prostrate form:) 
 	 i am willing to wait to be understood by the growth of the taste of myself, 
 i reject none, i permit all. 
 	 
 (say, o mother! have i not to your thought been faithful? 
 have i not, through life, kept you and yours before me?) 
 	 
 15 
 i swear i begin to see the meaning of these things! 
 it is not the earth, it is not america, who is so great, 
 it is i who am great, or to be great it is you up there, or any one; 
 it is to walk rapidly through civilizations, governments, theories, 
 through poems, pageants, shows, to form great individuals. 
 	 
 underneath all, individuals! 
 i swear nothing is good to me now that ignores individuals, 
 the american compact is altogether with individuals, 
 the only government is that which makes minute of individuals, 
 the whole theory of the universe is directed to one single individual namely, to you. 
 	 
 	 
 (mother! with subtle sense severe with the naked sword in your hand, 
 i saw you at last refuse to treat but directly with individuals.) 
 	 
 16 
 underneath all, nativity, 
 i swear i will stand by my own nativity pious or impious, so be it; 
 i swear i am charm'd with nothing except nativity, 
 men, women, cities, nations, are only beautiful from nativity. 
 	 
 underneath all is the need of the expression of love for men and women, 
 i swear i have seen enough of mean and impotent modes of expressing love for men and 
 	  	  women, 
 after this day i take my own modes of expressing love for men and women. 
 	 
 i swear i will have each quality of my race in myself, 
 (talk as you like, he only suits these states whose manners favor the audacity and sublime 
 	  turbulence of the states.) 
 	 
 underneath the lessons of things, spirits, nature, governments, ownerships, i swear i 
 	  	  perceive 
 	  other lessons, 
 underneath all, to me is myself to you, yourself (the same monotonous old song.) 
 	 
 	 
 17 
 o i see now, flashing, that this america is only you and me, 
 its power, weapons, testimony, are you and me, 
 its crimes, lies, thefts, defections, slavery, are you and me, 
 its congress is you and me the officers, capitols, armies, ships, are you and me, 
 its endless gestations of new states are you and me, 
 the war that war so bloody and grim the war i will henceforth forget was 
 	  	  you and 
 	  me, 
 natural and artificial are you and me, 
 freedom, language, poems, employments, are you and me, 
 past, present, future, are you and me. 
 	 
 18 
 i swear i dare not shirk any part of myself, 
 not any part of america, good or bad, 
 not the promulgation of liberty not to cheer up slaves and horrify foreign despots, 
 not to build for that which builds for mankind, 
 not to balance ranks, complexions, creeds, and the sexes, 
 not to justify science, nor the march of equality, 
 nor to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn beloved of time. 
 	 
 i swear i am for those that have never been master'd! 
 for men and women whose tempers have never been master'd, 
 for those whom laws, theories, conventions, can never master. 
 	 
 i swear i am for those who walk abreast with the whole earth! 
 who inaugurate one, to inaugurate all. 
 	 
 i swear i will not be outfaced by irrational things! 
 i will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic upon me! 
 i will make cities and civilizations defer to me! 
 this is what i have learnt from america it is the amount and it i teach again. 
 	 
 (democracy! while weapons were everywhere aim'd at your breast, 
 i saw you serenely give birth to immortal children saw in dreams your dilating form; 
 saw you with spreading mantle covering the world.) 
 	 
 19 
 i will confront these shows of the day and night! 
 i will know if i am to be less than they! 
 i will see if i am not as majestic as they! 
 i will see if i am not as subtle and real as they! 
 i will see if i am to be less generous than they! 
 i will see if i have no meaning, while the houses and ships have meaning! 
 i will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough for themselves, and i am not to be 
 	  	  enough 
 	  for myself. 
 	 
 20 
 i match my spirit against yours, you orbs, growths, mountains, brutes, 
 copious as you are, i absorb you all in myself, and become the master myself. 
 	 
 america isolated, yet embodying all, what is it finally except myself? 
 these states what are they except myself? 
 	 
 i know now why the earth is gross, tantalizing, wicked it is for my sake, 
 i take you to be mine, you beautiful, terrible, rude forms. 
 	 
 (mother! bend down, bend close to me your face! 
 i know not what these plots and wars, and deferments are for; 
 i know not fruition's success but i know that through war and peace your work 
 	  	  goes 
 	  on, and must yet go on.) 
 	 
 21 
 .... thus, by blue ontario's shore, 
 while the winds fann'd me, and the waves came trooping toward me, 
 i thrill'd with the power's pulsations and the charm of my theme was upon 
 	  	  me, 
 till the tissues that held me, parted their ties upon me. 
 	 
 and i saw the free souls of poets; 
 the loftiest bards of past ages strode before me, 
 strange, large men, long unwaked, undisclosed, were disclosed to me. 
 	 
 22 
 o my rapt verse, my call mock me not! 
 not for the bards of the past not to invoke them have i launch'd you forth, 
 not to call even those lofty bards here by ontario's shores, 
 have i sung so capricious and loud, my savage song. 
 	 
 bards for my own land, only, i invoke; 
 (for the war, the war is over the field is clear'd,) 
 till they strike up marches henceforth triumphant and onward, 
 to cheer, o mother, your boundless, expectant soul. 
 	 
 bards grand as these days so grand! 
 bards of the great idea! bards of the peaceful inventions! (for the war, the war is over!) 
 	 
 yet bards of the latent armies a million soldiers waiting, ever ready, 
 bards towering like hills (no more these dots, these pigmies, these little piping 
 	  	  straws, 
 	  these gnats, that fill the hour, to pass for poets;) 
 bards with songs as from burning coals, or the lightning's fork'd stripes! 
 ample ohio's bards bards for california! inland bards bards of the war;) 
 (as a wheel turns on its axle, so i find my chants turning finally on the war;) 
 bards of pride! bards tallying the ocean's roar, and the swooping eagle's 
 	  	  scream! 
 you, by my charm, i invoke! 
 locations and times what is it in me that meets them all, whenever and wherever, and 
 	  	  makes 
 	  me at home? 
 forms, colors, densities, odors what is it in me that corresponds with them? 
 o me! o life!... of the questions of these recurring; 
 of the endless trains of the faithless of cities fill'd with the foolish; 
 of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than i, and who more 
 	  	  faithless?) 
 of eyes that vainly crave the light of the objects mean of the struggle ever 
 	  renew'd; 
 of the poor results of all of the plodding and sordid crowds i see around me; 
 of the empty and useless years of the rest with the rest me intertwined; 
 the question, o me! so sad, recurring what good amid these, o me, o life? 
 	 
 answer. 
 that you are here that life exists, and identity; 
 that the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute a verse. 
 through the soft evening air enwrinding all, 
 rocks, woods, fort, cannon, pacing sentries, endless wilds, 
 in dulcet streams, in flutes' and cornets' notes, 
 electric, pensive, turbulent artificial, 
 (yet strangely fitting even here, meanings unknown before, 
 subtler than ever, more harmony, as if born here, related here, 
 not to the city's fresco'd rooms, not to the audience of the opera house, 
 sounds, echoes, wandering strains, as really here at home, 
 sonnambula's innocent love, trios with norma's anguish, 
 and thy ecstatic chorus poliuto;) 
 ray'd in the limpid yellow slanting sundown, 
 music, italian music in dakota. 
 	 
 while nature, sovereign of this gnarl'd realm, 
 lurking in hidden barbaric grim recesses, 
 acknowledging rapport however far remov'd, 
 (as some old root or soil of earth its last born flower or fruit,) 
 listens well pleas'd. 
 i see the sleeping babe, nestling the breast of its mother; 
 the sleeping mother and babe hush'd, i study them long and long. 
 pensive, on her dead gazing, i heard the mother of all, 
 desperate, on the torn bodies, on the forms covering the battle fields gazing; 
 (as the last gun ceased but the scent of the powder smoke linger'd;) 
 as she call'd to her earth with mournful voice while she stalk'd: 
 absorb them well, o my earth, she cried i charge you, lose not my sons! lose not an 
 	  	  atom; 
 and you streams, absorb them well, taking their dear blood; 
 and you local spots, and you airs that swim above lightly, 
 and all you essences of soil and growth and you, my rivers' depths; 
 and you, mountain sides and the woods where my dear children's blood, trickling, 
 	  redden'd; 
 and you trees, down in your roots, to bequeath to all future trees, 
 my dead absorb my young men's beautiful bodies absorb and their precious, 
 	  precious, precious blood; 
 which holding in trust for me, faithfully back again give me, many a year hence, 
 in unseen essence and odor of surface and grass, centuries hence; 
 in blowing airs from the fields, back again give me my darlings give my immortal 
 	  	  heroes; 
 exhale me them centuries hence breathe me their breath let not an atom be lost; 
 o years and graves! o air and soil! o my dead, an aroma sweet! 
 exhale them perennial, sweet death, years, centuries hence. 
 1 
 brother of all, with generous hand, 
 of thee, pondering on thee, as o'er thy tomb, i and my soul, 
 a thought to launch in memory of thee, 
 a burial verse for thee. 
 	 
 what may we chant, o thou within this tomb? 
 what tablets, pictures, hang for thee, o millionaire? 
 	 the life thou lived'st we know not, 
 but that thou walk'dst thy years in barter, 'mid the haunts of brokers; 
 nor heroism thine, nor war, nor glory. 
 	 
 yet lingering, yearning, joining soul with thine, 
 if not thy past we chant, we chant the future, 
 select, adorn the future. 
 	 
 2 
 lo, soul, the graves of heroes! 
 the pride of lands the gratitudes of men, 
 the statues of the manifold famous dead, old world and new, 
 the kings, inventors, generals, poets, (stretch wide thy vision, soul,) 
 the excellent rulers of the races, great discoverers, sailors, 
 marble and brass select from them, with pictures, scenes, 
 (the histories of the lands, the races, bodied there, 
 in what they've built for, graced and graved, 
 monuments to their heroes.) 
 	 
 3 
 silent, my soul, 
 with drooping lids, as waiting, ponder'd, 
 turning from all the samples, all the monuments of heroes. 
 	 
 while through the interior vistas, 
 noiseless uprose, phantasmic (as, by night, auroras of the north,) 
 lambent tableaux, prophetic, bodiless scenes, 
 spiritual projections. 
 	 
 in one, among the city streets, a laborer's home appear'd, 
 after his day's work done, cleanly, sweet air'd, the gaslight burning, 
 the carpet swept, and a fire in the cheerful stove. 
 	 
 in one, the sacred parturition scene, 
 a happy, painless mother birth'd a perfect child. 
 	 
 in one, at a bounteous morning meal, 
 sat peaceful parents, with contented sons. 
 	 
 in one, by twos and threes, young people, 
 hundreds concentering, walk'd the paths and streets and roads, 
 toward a tall domed school. 
 	 
 in one a trio, beautiful, 
 grandmother, loving daughter, loving daughter's daughter, sat, 
 chatting and sewing. 
 	 
 in one, along a suite of noble rooms, 
 'mid plenteous books and journals, paintings on the walls, fine statuettes, 
 were groups of friendly journeymen, mechanics, young and old, 
 reading, conversing. 
 	 
 all, all the shows of laboring life, 
 city and country, women's, men's and children's, 
 their wants provided for, hued in the sun, and tinged for once with joy, 
 marriage, the street, the factory, farm, the house room, lodging room, 
 labor and toil, the bath, gymnasium, play ground, library, college, 
 the student, boy or girl, led forward to be taught; 
 the sick cared for, the shoeless shod the orphan father'd and mother'd, 
 the hungry fed, the houseless housed; 
 (the intentions perfect and divine, 
 the workings, details, haply human.) 
 	 
 4 
 o thou within this tomb, 
 from thee, such scenes thou stintless, lavish giver, 
 tallying the gifts of earth large as the earth, 
 thy name an earth, with mountains, fields and rivers. 
 	 
 nor by your streams alone, you rivers, 
 by you, your banks, connecticut, 
 by you, and all your teeming life, old thames, 
 by you, potomac, laving the ground washington trod by you patapsco, 
 you, hudson you, endless mississippi not by you alone, 
 but to the high seas launch, my thought, his memory. 
 	 
 5 
 lo, soul, by this tomb's lambency, 
 the darkness of the arrogant standards of the world, 
 with all its flaunting aims, ambitions, pleasures. 
 	 
 (old, commonplace, and rusty saws, 
 the rich, the gay, the supercilious, smiled at long, 
 now, piercing to the marrow in my bones, 
 fused with each drop my heart's blood jets, 
 swim in ineffable meaning.) 
 	 
 lo, soul, the sphere requireth, portioneth, 
 to each his share, his measure, 
 the moderate to the moderate, the ample to the ample. 
 	 
 lo, soul, see'st thou not, plain as the sun, 
 the only real wealth of wealth in generosity, 
 the only life of life in goodness?
