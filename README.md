# tankanizer

Using Allison Parrish's [Pronouncing](https://github.com/aparrish/pronouncingpy) to count syllables, I experiment with generating poetry in the tanka form using several corpora and a Markov chain.

Thinking as I'm typing that perhaps I can use the Markov chain to generate poetry that I can then use to train a more sophisticated RNN generator. Some sort of text generation loop.

Early stages!
